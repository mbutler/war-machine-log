The D&D® *Cyclopedia* is as accurate a name as you could want for this book. A "cyclopedia" is an encyclopedia, and this book is an encyclopedia of all major D&D game rules.

This book is intended to be a reference volume for those who already play the D&D game. You'll find it much more convenient to look up a specific rule here than in earlier versions of the game. Just about everything appearing in the boxed sets is here—but in a more convenient format. For example, all the game's spells are in one place, and all the details of creating a fighter-class character are in one location.

However, though this book is aimed at the experienced user, it is possible to learn to play the D&D game from these pages. The *Cyclopedia* lacks many of the examples and the patient explanation you'll find in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® boxed sets, but you can still learn to play from these rules.

## What Is Role-Playing?

Before television, there was radio. Audiences earlier in this century sat in front of their radios and thrilled to the exploits of bigger-than-life radio heroes. Since it was radio, they couldn't see what was going on, but they didn't need to—all the action was described by dialogue, narration, and sound effects, and was translated by the imaginations of the listeners into scenes they could see, experience, and remember.

Role-playing games are much like radio adventures, except for one important detail: they're interactive. One player provides the narrative and some of the dialogue, but the other players, instead of just sitting and envisioning what's going on, actually *participate*. Each player controls the actions of a character in the story, decides on his actions, supplies his character's dialogue, and makes decisions based on the character's personality and his current game options.

The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is a fantasy role-playing game. This means that it's set in a world where men and women can wield powerful magic, where monsters like dragons thrive, and where heroes like Sinbad, Hercules, and Lancelot abound.

When you play the D&D game, one player will become the Dungeon Master (also known as the DM or referee). He or she will create the world and setting in which the adventures will be taking place and will create a variety of characters to populate the world. The DM will also develop situations taking place in that world and will then run adventures—acting as the main narrator of the stories in which the other players' characters will participate.

The other players will create characters—the heroes of the DM's story. The DM will present their characters with situations, and they'll decide how to react to those situations. Several situations progressing toward a conclusion become an *adventure* or story; a number of adventures played one after another become a *campaign*.

## Setting Up

When a group gets together to play, everyone should bring what they need, including dice, pencils and papers, and characters (preferably on character sheets).

A table is normally used, the DM sitting at one end with information about the dungeon. The DM often uses an upright piece of stiff cardboard (called a screen) to hide the description and maps of the dungeon so they are not accidentally seen by the players.

The players sit around the table, away from the DM, where they can all easily see any maps made during the adventure, the order of the figures (if used), and so forth.

During the game, players should be allowed to refer to any player's aids whenever they wish, including the character creation section of the *Cyclopedia* (Chapters 1-5). However, they should not be allowed to see everything in this book. The mystery and excitement on unknown monsters and magic can be spoiled if someone looks up all the details during the game.

## Mapping and Calling

Although each person will be playing the role of a character, the players should also handle the jobs of mapping and calling. Any player can be the mapper or caller.

The *mapper* is the player who draws a map of the dungeon as it is explored. One or more of the characters should be making maps, but one of the players must make the actual map. The map should be kept on the table for all to see and refer to. Pencil should be used when making the map, in case of errors or tricky passages.

If the party's movement carries it into new and unmapped territory, the DM will describe the area in detail so the party's mapper can map it. If something such as a secret door or treasure item is discovered, the DM describes it and announces the results if the characters examine it.

The *caller* is a player selected by the other players to describe party actions so the DM doesn't have to listen to several voices at once. He or she tells the DM what the party is doing this turn. If the DM prefers, each individual player can describe his own actions. The caller is just a convenience in many campaigns; it's not a game rule that players have to use.

## Using the Dice

Often the characters want to do something that involves an element of chance. Say someone wants to leap onto a galloping horse. He might make it—or he might not! You can roll dice to decide if the action succeeds. In the D&D game there are many kinds of dice: four-, six-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and even twenty-sided dice.

A four-sided die looks like a pyramid. Drop it on the table. Read the numbers that are face up along the bottom of the die. This number is the result of the roll.

When rolling any die with six sides or more, one side always lands face up. This number is the result. On the ten-sided die, the number 0 is usually read as 10.

You can use a ten-sided die to find a percentage (a number from 1-100). Roll the die once. Read the result as the "tens" digit, counting a 0 as "no tens." Roll a second time and read the result as the "ones" digit. If both rolls are zeroes, the result is 100.

We often use abbreviations to refer to various kinds of dice: a "d" followed by the number of

the die's sides. For example, "d6" refers to a six-sided die. We use "d%" or 1d100 to refer to a percentage die.

There are no two- or three-sided dice, but we can pretend there are. We use a coin for a d2—heads is 1, tails is 2. To make a d3, roll a d6, and then divide the result by two and round up.

Often, a number appears before the "d" as well as after it. This shows the number of times you should roll the die. (For example, 2d8 means roll the eight-sided die twice.) When you roll a die more than once, add the results of the rolls together. So, 3d6 means roll the six-sided die three times and add the results. For example, a 3d6 roll of 3, 5, and 1 is 9 (3 + 5 + 1 = 9).

## Cyclopedia Organization

This book is divided into the character creation section, the rules section, and the appendices.

## Character Creation Section

In this section of the book, we're going to describe everything needed to know in order to create a *player character*—a character played by any player except the Dungeon Master. The DM, too, will find this section useful when creating human and demi-human nonplayer characters.

In this section, Chapters 1-5 give you a basic understanding of the D&D game rules; a thorough description of the way human and demi-human characters are created; information on the spells, skills, and equipment the characters use to accomplish their objectives; and information on the things players and their characters need to do in the course of a game.

## Rules Section

This section of the book, covering Chapters 6-19, gives detailed information on handling movement, encounters, and combat; it also covers procedures such as mass combat, granting experience, and playing nonplayer characters. Its largest components include all information needed for monsters, Immortals, and treasure. In addition, this section discusses Dungeon Master procedures, campaigning, variant rules, and the planes of existence.

## Appendices

The appendices hold valuable information regarding the D&D game world and also on converting characters over to the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game. You'll find supplemental record sheets, useful forms, and indices for spells and rules.

## Pronoun Note

The male pronouns (he, him, his) are used throughout this book. We hope this won't be interpreted by anyone as an attempt to exclude females from the game or to imply their exclusion. Centuries of use have made these pronouns neutral, and we feel their use provides for clear and concise written text.

# Chapter 1: Steps in Character Creation

![Decorative flourish]()![](_page_5_Picture_1.jpeg)

Sooner or later you will want to make up your own new character. Before you start, get a pencil and the multisided dice used with the D&D® game. You will also need a blank character sheet (or a piece of notebook paper) to keep track of the details. A sample character sheet is found in Appendix 3.

If you are using a blank piece of paper, copy the form of the character sheet onto it—in other words, allow a space for your name and the character's name at the top left, a place for character class, level, armor class, and hit points below that, and so forth. The Dungeon Master should be present and should watch the creation of any player character, including all dice rolls.

Your first try at creating a new character will probably take an hour or so. Even when you are used to the procedure, it will still take 10-30 minutes. If the Dungeon Master is just beginning a new campaign, he should call everyone together for a session where all players create their characters and where he describes the campaign world in which the others will be playing. Once the campaign is underway, a player shouldn't try to create a character at the beginning of a play-session (unless the DM specifically asks him to)—it delays the start of the game. All the rolling, adjusting, buying, and so forth should be done beforehand.

The following is a list of the steps to take when making a new character; each step is then explained in detail.

#### Steps to creating a character:

1. Roll for ability scores
2. Choose a character class
3. Adjust ability scores
4. Roll for hit points
5. Roll for money
6. Buy equipment
7. Determine other numbers and rolls
8. Note adjustments for ability scores
9. Choose character alignment
10. Select name, personality, and background
11. Determine character height and weight
12. Earn experience

#### Roll for Ability Scores

##### Roll 3d6 for each ability:

| Strength     |
|--------------|
| Intelligence |
| Wisdom       |
| Dexterity    |
| Constitution |
| Charisma     |

Many of the attributes that make up a character—for instance, his physical might and his level of intelligence—are represented by numbers in the game. Six of these are the character's *abilities*: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.

*Strength (Str)* is the character's physical might. It affects the amount of damage the character does with hand-to-hand weapons (such as swords and clubs) and thrown weapons (such as thrown spears and knives), affects his chance to hit with hand-to-hand weapons, and determines

his ability to do such things as break down locked doors.

*Intelligence (Int)* is the character's mental might. It affects the number of languages the character can learn.

*Wisdom (Wis)* is the character's strength of understanding of the world, the way things work, the forces of nature, and so forth. It affects the character's natural ability to resist magical spells.

*Dexterity (Dex)* is the character's nimbleness and grace. It affects the character's ability to wield missile and thrown weapons (such as bows and throwing knives) and can make it harder for enemies to hit the character.

*Constitution (Con)* is the character's physical health and vigor. It affects the character's hit points score (i.e., his ability to survive being injured).

*Charisma (Cha)* is the character's force of personality and presence. It affects the way other characters, especially nonplayer characters controlled by the DM, react to the character.

You roll dice to find each ability score. This is done by rolling the six-sided die three times and adding the results. Or, if you have three six-sided dice, roll the dice together. (This is normally referred to in the text as "rolling 3d6.")

For example, if you roll ones each time, then the total score is 3, the least score possible. If you roll all sixes, then the total is 18, the highest score you can have.

You should end up with six numbers, each between 3 and 18. These are your character's ability scores. Write the scores down as you roll them,

next to the names of the abilities.

High ability scores can help the character in certain things. For example, high Strength allows a character to deal out more damage in combat; a high Constitution helps a character survive injury; a high Charisma helps a character attract friends. Low scores have exactly the opposite effect. We'll discuss these effects in the Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores Table.

You can adjust the ability scores in Step 3 ("Adjust Ability Scores"), but first you must decide what class your character will be.

#### Prime Requisites

Each character class requires prowess in one of the abilities—in other words, each class has an ability that is of utmost importance to that class. (For example, a fighter's most important ability is Strength and a cleric's is Wisdom.) These are known as *prime requisites*.

Each character class has its own prime requisite. This means each class is talented at certain things, such as fighting (fighters because of their Strength), healing (clerics because of their Wisdom), sneaking about (thieves because of their Dexterity), and so on. The higher a character's prime requisite score, the more skill he will have in his class (his "job"). Prime requisites for each class are listed with the character class.

#### Choose a Character Class

A character class is a character's main profession in the campaign. Think of each character

![Illustration of two men in a forest setting, one reading a large book, the other looking up at a horse.]()![](_page_5_Picture_30.jpeg)

# Chapter 1: Steps in Character Creation

class as a sort of stereotype. For instance, all warriors in books and movies have some features in common and those specific features, translated into the D&D® game terms, are what make up the fighter character class.

The player character (PC) classes available for you to choose include four human classes (cleric, fighter, magic-user, thief), three demihuman classes (dwarf, elf, halfling), and two special character classes (druid, mystic).

You've probably noticed that the names of the demihuman character classes sound more like race or species names than professions. That's because demihumans are more limited in their options than humans are, so the entire race can be represented by a single character class.

## Types of Character Classes

Most characters will be humans. In most D&D game campaigns, humans are the most widespread of all intelligent beings. Any new character can belong to one of the human classes (cleric, fighter, magic-user, thief), regardless of his ability scores.

### Character Classes and Ability Requirements Table

| Character  | Prime                  | Other                                           |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|            | Requisite(s)           | Requirements                                    |
| Cleric     | Wisdom                 | None                                            |
| Fighter    | Strength               | None                                            |
| Magic-User | Intelligence           | None                                            |
| Thief      | Dexterity              | None                                            |
| Dwarf      | Strength               | Constitution 9                                  |
| Elf        | Strength, Intelligence | Constitution 9                                  |
| Halfling   | Strength, Dexterity    | Constitution 9, Intelligence 9                  |
| Druid      | Wisdom                 | Neutral alignment, obtain 9th level as a cleric |
| Mystic     | Strength, Dexterity    | Wisdom 13, Dexterity 13                         |

Demihuman characters (dwarf, elf, and halfling) should be a little less common: these races are supposed to be somewhat exclusive and mysterious. They are known as "demihumans" because they are so similar to humans. Each demihuman character class has specific ability requirements. If a newly created character doesn't have high enough scores in some specific abilities, he can't belong to the demihuman classes.

The special character classes (druid and mystic) technically belong in the set of human character classes, but they have such stringent requirements and unusual guidelines that they're set aside for you to look at separately. The DM might not want to use them in his campaign; it's easier for him to make and enforce this decision if they're set aside.

## Descriptions of Character Classes

A *Cleric* is a human character who has dedicated his life to a great and worthy cause. Often, this cause is the cleric's alignment. A Lawful cleric, for example, would be dedicated to spreading

law and order throughout the campaign world. The cleric wields magic, and he can use almost as many weapons and armor types as a fighter. The cleric's prime requisite is his Wisdom.

A *Fighter* is a character whose main skill is his prowess at arms. A fighter can be a heavily armored knight or a lightly armored swashbuckler, but it's his extraordinary skill in combat that makes him special. In the game, a fighter's prime requisite is his Strength.

A *Magic-User* is a character who wields magic. He has little or nothing in the way of fighting ability, and in the early part of his career he has little in the way of magical ability either. But as he gains in experience, he becomes a powerful character and can wield powerful magical spells. A magic-user's prime requisite is his Intelligence.

A *Thief* is a character who has spying abilities. Whether he actually makes his living stealing from other people, he has many skills appropriate to that livelihood. He can move stealthily, climb sheer surfaces, pick locks, and so forth. He has combat abilities better than a magic-user's, but he's not a strong combatant. The thief's prime requisite is his Dexterity.

A *Dwarf* is a sturdy, squat demihuman. He resembles the fighter in many details, but has many special abilities—and special restrictions—that set him apart from human fighters. The dwarfs' prime requisite is his Strength. Also, a dwarf character *must* have a Constitution score of 9 or more. If the character you're creating has a Constitution of 8 or less, he cannot be a dwarf.

An *Elf* is a lean, nimble demihuman. He is a very capable combination of the fighter and magic-user classes. He's not quite as tough as a human fighter, nor will he ever achieve the great magical ability of a human magic-user, but he does have most of the abilities of both classes. He has other special abilities and restrictions that set him apart from the human classes. The elf has *two* prime requisites: Strength and Intelligence, and the Intelligence score must be 9 or more. If the character you're creating has an Intelligence of 8 or less, he cannot be an elf.

A *Halfling* is a small demihuman. He has many abilities similar to a fighter, but he is also noted for his ability in woodsmanship. He's not as tough as a fighter, and he has special abilities and restrictions that set him apart from the fighter class. The halfling has two prime requisites: Strength and Dexterity, and the Dexterity score must be 9 or more. Also, a halfling character *must* have a score of 9 or better for his Constitution.

A *Druid* is a special type of spellcaster who devotes himself to the needs and preservation of Nature. However, you can't start a character off as a druid. A druid character must start off as a cleric—in fact, as a cleric of the Neutral alignment (alignments are discussed in Step 9, "Choose Character Alignment")—and earn a lot of experience (up to 9th experience level) as a cleric. Only at that point can he become a druid.

A *Mystic* is a type of warrior-monk. He lives a monastic life, devotes himself to philosophy and the mastery of his physical body, and trains himself to become a master of unarmed fighting. Mystics are not appropriate to all campaigns, so the DM has the option of refusing to allow mystics in his world. The mystic's prime requisites

are Strength and Dexterity. Also, a mystic character *must* have scores of 13 or better in both his Wisdom and Dexterity abilities.

All these character classes will be described in greater detail in Chapter 2. If you don't yet know enough about these classes to decide what your new character should be, you can skip ahead to Chapter 2, then return here and make your choice. When you've decided what character class your character will be, continue with the next step.

## Adjust Ability Scores

You can trade two points from an ability score you don't want to raise your prime requisite by one point. You can perform this trade as many times as you want, so long as you do not lower any ability below a score of 9. You cannot lower your Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You can only raise your character's prime requisite score.

Once you've rolled your character's abilities and decided on his character class, it is possible to raise his prime requisite by lowering other ability scores. This is sort of like training hard to improve one skill while letting others become neglected. (For example, a magic-user might spend all his time studying hard, neglecting his exercise; he'd end up with a higher Intelligence and a lower Strength.)

These are the rules for exchanging ability points:

1. The prime requisite goes up 1 point for each 2 points that another ability score goes down. If a character has two prime requisites, both can be raised.
2. Constitution and Charisma points cannot be exchanged with others.
3. Dexterity cannot be lowered (but it may be raised for a thief or halfling character).
4. No score can be lowered below 9. If it is already 10 or less, it cannot be lowered.

*Example:* An elf has Intelligence and Strength scores of 12 and a Wisdom of 13. His player wants him to be both stronger and smarter. He drops the Wisdom score by 2, to 11, so 1 point can be added to Strength. Then he drops the Wisdom again, to 9, and adds 1 to Intelligence. This results are Intelligence and Strength scores of 13 and an adjusted Wisdom of 9.

A cleric with Strength and Wisdom of 15 drops the Strength by 6 (to 9) and raises the Wisdom by 3 (to 18).

If you want to exchange any ability score points, you must do that now before you go any further in making the character. No such adjustments can be made later. Remember that you do not have to adjust any ability scores. This is an option, not a requirement.

## Roll for Hit Points

Your character's hit point score represents his ability to survive injury. The higher his hit point score, the more damage he can sustain before dying. Characters who survive long enough to

![Decorative graphic element]()![](_page_7_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 1: Steps in Character Creation

![Decorative graphic element]()![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

gain a good deal of experience typically gain more and more hit points; therefore, an experienced character lasts longer in a fight or other dangerous situations than does an inexperienced character.

A character's profession (his character class) dramatically affects the number of hit points he receives. Fighters and dwarves receive a lot of hit points. Magic-users and thieves receive only a few. The other classes receive a medium amount.

Find your character's class on the Character Class and Hit Dice Table, and then roll the type of die indicated in order to find your starting hit points. Note that your character's Constitution score can affect the number of hit points he will have. Look for the Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores Table and apply the appropriate number to the number of hit points rolled for your character.

## Character Class and Hit Dice Table

| Character Class | Die for Hit Points |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Cleric          | 1d6                |
| Fighter         | 1d8                |
| Magic-user      | 1d4                |
| Thief           | 1d4                |
| Dwarf           | 1d8                |
| Elf             | 1d6                |
| Halfing         | 1d6                |
| Druid           | *                  |
| Mystic          | 1d6                |

\* Does not apply.

## Roll for Money

Roll 3d6 and multiply by 10 to find your character's starting gold pieces.

Your character starts out with no possessions except for normal clothes and a little money, saved up over many years. You will need to go shopping for equipment, but first you must find out how much money you have.

Roll 3d6 (three six-sided dice), and multiply the total by 10. (For example, if you roll 12, the total is 120.) This is the number of gold pieces (gp) that you start with. Write that on your character sheet. If you're using a hand-written sheet, write down the word "Money" on the back and put beside it the number you've just rolled.

## Buy Equipment

Now that you have your money, you can spend it on the equipment you need to go adventuring. There is a complete list of equipment in Chapter 4 later in this book. Be sure to ask your Dungeon Master if everything on that list is available in his campaign. If his campaign deviates a lot from the "standard" D&D® game campaign, he could have a very different list of equipment, which he should provide for you.

There are restrictions on what items your character is allowed to have, especially on armor and weapons. Before you go shopping, be sure you have read the full description of your character class, later in this chapter.

For example, a magic-user cannot wear any ar-

mor at all and can only use a few types of weapons. It would be a waste of money for a character of this class to buy a sword or shield; instead, his money can be saved or spent on oil, torches, and other items. Thieves, however, must buy thieves' tools to use their Open Locks ability.

On a piece of piece paper, write down all the equipment you want to buy and add up the cost. If it costs more gold pieces than you have, you must erase something from the list. When you can pay for your list of equipment, subtract the cost from your money, and write the equipment down on your character sheet.

Be careful when shopping! You may forget to buy rope, for example, and suddenly find a need for it during an adventure—and if you didn't buy it, you don't have it. Ask the other players and your DM for advice on what to buy—and what *not* to buy. Remember that money can be saved for buying expensive equipment later.

## Don't Forget Spells

If your character is a spellcaster, he will also need to equip himself with the spells he knows. Magic-users know one spell at their first level of experience, while clerics learn their first spell at second level. Ask your DM for the spells which your character knows.

Magic-users also need to have spell books to record the spells they know. A magic-user's first spell book is free, a gift of the wizard who taught him. Clerics do not need spell books.

## Determine Other Numbers and Rolls

Armor class, attack rolls, and saving throws are numbers—numbers which you'll calculate from the character's other attributes or find on provided tables—which are important to the way the character performs in combat.

### Armor Class

Armor class, sometimes abbreviated as AC, is a number indicating how tough it is to hit your character. With the armor class, unlike most numbers in the D&D game, a *low* number is good for a character, and a *high* number is bad.

Your armor class is a combination of the type of armor you are wearing, plus any adjustments due to Dexterity. First, find your armor type on the Armor Type and Armor Class Table.

### Armor Type and Armor Class Table

| Armor Type    | Armor Class |
|---------------|-------------|
| No armor      | 9           |
| Leather armor | 7           |
| Scale armor   | 6           |
| Chain mail    | 5           |
| Banded armor  | 4           |
| Plate mail    | 3           |
| Suit armor    | 0           |
| Shield        | Subtract 1* |

\* If using a shield, subtract 1 from the AC number. Example: chain mail alone is AC 5, but with a shield it is AC 4.

Once you know your armor class as provided by your armor type, you can determine adjust-

ments to your armor class from your Dexterity.

Find your Dexterity score on the Bonuses and Penalties For Ability Scores table. For every +1 on the table, subtract 1 from your armor class. For every -1, add 1 to your armor class.

Example: If you are wearing chain mail and a shield (AC 4), but have a Dexterity score of 15 (+1 bonus), your armor class number improves and goes down, to 3. If you are wearing plate mail and shield (AC 2) but have a Dexterity score of 5 (~2 penalty), your armor class worsens and goes up to 4.

Remember: The lower the AC number, the harder you are to hit. A penalty to armor class actually raises the number, making you easier to hit. If your AC is even better than zero, then negative numbers, or "minus" numbers, are used. For example, a character with a Dexterity Score of 18 (a +3 bonus, which translates to -3 to the AC) and wearing plate mail and shield (AC 2) would have an AC of "minus one" (-1).

## Attack Rolls

An *attack roll* is a number representing how easy or difficult it is for your character to hit other targets.

In combat, when your character is trying to hit another character, you roll 1d20; this is known as his attack roll. (In some game supplements, it's also called the "hit roll," "to-hit roll," or "roll to hit.") Once you know the number you've rolled on the die, you add any bonuses your character gets from high ability scores, magical weapons, or other factors. You'll compare that final result to the number required to hit the armor class of your character's opponent. If you reach or exceed that number, your character has successfully hit his opponent.

But how do you find out what number you need to hit a certain armor class? That's simple enough: We provide it to you on handy tables. Take a look at the Attack Rolls Table on page 106. Go ahead and flip forward to that table and return here when you've looked at it.

To use the table, cross-reference your character's experience level and character class with his opponent's armor class. On the table, "MU" stands for magic-user, "C.T.D" stands for "clerics, thieves, and druids," "F" stands for "fighters" (and also includes mystics and low-level demihumans), and "DH" stands for "demihumans" (and is used for high-experience demihumans). The numbers "19" through "-20" stand for the opposition's armor class.

A 1st level fighter attacks an enemy with an armor class (AC) of 2. On the Attack Rolls Table in Chapter 8, go to the "F" (for fighter) column, go down to where it says "1-3" (which means "Experience Levels 1 through 3"), and then go right to the column corresponding to AC 2. You need to roll a 17 to hit that armor class.

### Attack Rolls Tables vs. THACO

Now, record your character's attack rolls on the character sheet. There are two ways to do this. One is for beginning players and for players who sometimes have a hard time juggling numbers; the other is for experienced players who don't have trouble juggling numbers.

# Chapter 1: Steps in Character Creation

![Decorative floral border]()![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Attack Rolls:** With the first way, you write down your character's rolls to hit several armor classes. Instead of recording all the listed armor classes (19 to -20), we usually record only ACs 9 to -5; these are the armor classes most commonly encountered in a game.

On your character sheet, you'd make a small, simple table listing the attack rolls for your character's level and character class. An example is given on this page of the attack rolls for a first level fighter; for all characters, refer to the main table in Chapter 8, then write down the pertinent information on your character sheet. This way, when your first level fighter is attacking an AC of -2, you'd be able to look down on his character sheet and see immediately that he needs to achieve a roll of 20 to hit his target.

**THACO:** The abbreviation **THACO** stands for "To Hit Armor Class 0." There's nothing mysterious about it: It's just the number your character needs to hit armor class 0. On the table immediately above, for example, you see that a 1st level fighter needs to achieve a roll of 19 to hit an armor class of 0; therefore, his THACO is 19.

Some experienced players will not want to have an entire table cluttering up their character sheets; they'll just record their characters' THACO number. Additionally, many abbreviated descriptions of monsters used in D&D® game adventures will use the THACO number.

To use THACO, you have to do some adding and subtracting during combat. *You* subtract your modified attack roll (the number rolled on a 20-sided die plus any bonuses) from your THACO, and the result is the armor class your character hits.

For example, Ruggin is a 3rd level dwarf, and he's fighting a hobgoblin clad in chain mail (AC 5). Ruggin's THACO is 19, and he rolls a 16; Ruggin successfully hits his opponent's armor class (19 - 16 = 3) since he hit an AC 3 (two better than AC 5).

Likewise, instead of figuring out which AC your attack hits, you can use THACO to determine what number is needed to hit a specific armor class. Subtract the defender's armor class from the attacker's THACO. If the armor class is a negative value, add the armor class number to the attacker's THACO. The result is the number the attacker needs to hit his opponent.

For instance, Ruggin the 3rd level dwarf needs a 19 or better on a 20-sided die to hit a monster with AC 0. Ruggin is facing a troll (AC 4) and he needs a roll of 15 or greater to hit the monster (19 - 4 = 15).

If you're a beginning player, you should stick to the larger table; when you're comfortable with it, you can practice using the THACO number. When you're equally comfortable with THACO, you can stop recording the whole table on your character sheet, and merely record THACO.

## Saving Throws

Find your character's class and experience level on the Saving Throws Table in Chapter 8. Move across to the column representing the type of attack your character is sustaining. The number shown in that column is your saving throw. Roll that number or better on 1d20 to avoid or diminish the effects of the attack.

A *saving throw* represents your character's attempt to avoid the effects of some sort of unusual attack—poison, magical spells, the flaming breath of a dragon, and so forth. A successful saving throw means that the character either sustains a reduced amount of damage or suffers no harmful effect at all, depending on the type of attack. An unsuccessful saving throw means that the character sustains the full damage or effect of the attack. The saving throw is rolled on 1d20 when specified by the DM.

A character doesn't have just one saving throw number; he has a different one for each of five different categories of unusual attacks. Those categories include "Poison or Death Ray," "Magic Wand," "Turning to Stone or Paralysis," "Dragon Breath," and "Spells or Magic Staff."

Saving throws are based on your character's class and experience level. You can find your character's saving throws on the Saving Throws Table on page 109 of Chapter 8. Go ahead and flip to that table, look it over, and return here.

To find the saving throws for your character, simply look up his class and experience level. For example, if your character is a 1st level elf, his saving throws would be:

Death Ray or Poison: 12; Magic Wand: 13; Paralysis or Turn to Stone: 15; Dragon Breath: 15; Spells or Staff: 15

Write the saving throws appropriate for your character on his character sheet.

## High Wisdom and Saving Throws

If a character has a Wisdom score of 13 or more, he receives a bonus to one of his saving throws; if his Wisdom is 8 or less, he receives a penalty.

Take a look at the Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores Table below. If your Wisdom score is high or low enough for a bonus or penalty, record that on your character sheet beside your Wisdom score. This bonus or penalty affects your character's saving throws vs. spells. When rolling your saving throw vs. spells, you can add the character's Wisdom bonus to his saving throw (or must subtract the penalty, if he has a penalty instead).

## Note Adjustments for Ability Scores

You've already seen, on several occasions, that high abilities give your character special bo-

nuses, while low ones give the character special penalties. Below are the character's abilities and notes on what sorts of adjustments high and low abilities will bring him.

When you have high scores in abilities, note the specific adjustments which result from them; if you're not using a character sheet which already has blanks for these adjustments, place them beside the abilities (Strength, etc.) which grant them to the character. The Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores Table shows ability adjustments.

### Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores

| Ability Score | Adjustment    |
|---------------|---------------|
| 2-3           | -3 Penalty    |
| 4-5           | -2 Penalty    |
| 6-8           | -1 Penalty    |
| 9-12          | No adjustment |
| 13-15         | +1 Bonus      |
| 16-17         | +2 Bonus      |
| 18            | +3 Bonus      |

Now, let's go through each of the abilities and see what high scores will do for each ability.

### Strength

High Strength affects how well a character hits with melee weapons—that is, hand-held weapons. It affects how much damage the character does with melee weapons, and with thrown weapons like hurled knives and spears. And it affects how often a character can budge stuck doorways.

The character's adjustment for a high Strength score is applied to any roll he makes to hit someone in melee combat.

For instance, if a character has a Strength of 17 (therefore, a +2 adjustment), and rolls a 9 on his 1d20 to hit someone, he gets to add his Strength adjustment to that roll. He has actually achieved a roll of 11 (9 + 2 = 11). If the character has a Strength of 8 (therefore, a -1 penalty) and rolls a 9, he has to subtract his penalty; he has actually achieved a roll of 8 (9 - 1 = 8).

The character's adjustment for Strength is also applied to damage he does with melee and thrown weapons.

For example, let us say a character with Strength 18 (adjustment +3) hits someone with a sword and does 8 points of damage. He adds his Strength bonus to the damage, and so has actually done 11 points of damage. Likewise, a character with a Strength of 5 (adjustment -2) who rolls 8 points of damage has actually only done 6 points of damage (8 - 2 = 6).

Finally, the character gets his bonus or penalty to his Open Doors roll. The Open Doors roll is the character's ability to force open stuck doors. (The DM can optionally use it to decide whether the character is strong enough to perform similar feats of strength, such as moving obstructions.) The Open Doors roll is rolled on a 1d6, with a roll of 5 or 6 meaning success; the character with high Strength applies his adjustment to the number he rolls on the die. However, a natural, unmodified "6" on an Open doors roll will always open a door, despite any penalties to the contrary.

| AC:          | 9  | 8  | 7  | 6  | 5  | 4  | 3  | 2  | 1  | 0  | -1 | -2 | -3 | -4 | -5 |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Attack Roll: | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 |

## Abilities and Adjustments Table

| Ability      | Adjustments To:                                                                                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strength     | Attack Rolls (Melee Weapons and Unarmed Combat), Damage Rolls (Melee and Thrown Weapons), Opening Doors |
| Intelligence | Languages, General Skills (Optional)                                                                    |
| Wisdom       | Saving Throws vs. Spells                                                                                |
| Dexterity    | Attack Rolls (Thrown and Missile Weapons), Armor Class                                                  |
| Constitution | Hit Points per Experience Level                                                                         |
| Charisma     | Reactions from NPCs                                                                                     |

For example, a character with Strength 13 (adjustment +1) tries to budge a stuck door. On his 1d6, he rolls a 4. This isn't enough; it's not a 5 or 6. But he adds his +1 adjustment, his 4 becomes a 5, and suddenly it's enough: He can budge the stuck door. Similarly, a character with Strength 3 (adjustment -3) tries a similarly stuck door. On his 1d6, he rolls a 5, normally a success. But he must apply his -3 adjustment and his 5 suddenly becomes a 2, a failure.

## Intelligence

High Intelligence affects the number of languages a character knows. If the DM is using the optional general skills rules, high Intelligence also affects the number of general skills the character knows.

A human character of "average" Intelligence (a score of 9-12) knows two languages: the Common tongue and an alignment tongue. The character can read and write those languages. (The Common tongue is the "standard" tongue for the campaign. A campaign set in modern America would have English as its Common tongue, for example.) Demihuman characters usually know additional languages, as described for each demihuman character class.

If the character receives an adjustment from an Intelligence over 12 (a bonus, in other words), this is the number of languages the character can read and write. Your Dungeon Master will tell you what languages are available. You must choose your added languages before you play the character in a game.

If the Intelligence adjustment is a penalty, then the character has trouble writing and perhaps speaking.

In either case, look at the Intelligence and Languages Table.

## Intelligence and Languages Table

| Score | Languages                                                  |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3     | Has trouble speaking, cannot read or write                 |
| 4-5   | Cannot read or write Common                                |
| 6-8   | Can write simple Common words                              |
| 9-12  | Reads and writes native languages (usually two)            |
| 13-15 | Reads and writes native languages, +1 additional language  |
| 16-17 | Reads and writes native languages, +2 additional languages |
| 18    | Reads and writes native languages, +3 additional languages |

him—when the character is talking to them (but not unless he is talking).

If he tries to hire retainers (bodyguards, assistants, and so forth), his Charisma will determine the number he can hire, and how loyal they will be. Your Dungeon Master will tell you if any retainers are available, and will play the roles of the retainers your character finds and (possibly) hires.

## Charisma Adjustment Table

| Charisma | Reaction | Max. No.  | Retainer |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Score    | Adj.     | Retainers | Morale   |
| 3        | -3       | 1         | 4        |
| 4-5      | -2       | 2         | 5        |
| 6-8      | -1       | 3         | 6        |
| 9-12     | No adj.  | 4         | 7        |
| 13-15    | +1       | 5         | 8        |
| 16-17    | +2       | 6         | 9        |
| 18       | +3       | 7         | 10       |

If your campaign makes use of a lot of languages—especially common in a campaign where the player characters travel through a lot of foreign lands, or where there are a lot of talking monster species—a character's ability with languages can be very important.

## Wisdom

The effects of a high Wisdom are discussed above, under "High Wisdom and Saving Throws." Adjustments for high Wisdom scores affect the character's saving throws vs. spells.

## Dexterity

The effects of a high Dexterity are discussed above, under "Armor Class." Adjustments for high Dexterity scores affect the character's AC.

They also affect the character's ability to hit with missile weapons—any thrown weapons or weapons launched through the air. The character's adjustment for a high or low Dexterity is applied to his roll to hit when he is using missile weapons.

For example, a character with a 17 Dexterity (adjustment +2), using a bow, is trying to shoot a distant enemy. He needs a 13 to hit his enemy. On his 1d20 attack roll, he rolls a 12. He has failed. But now he adds his bonus for high Dexterity (+2) and his 12 becomes a 14: He has actually hit his opponent.

## Constitution

Your Constitution score can affect the number of hit points you have. Look earlier in this chapter for the Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores table, and apply the bonus or penalty to the number of hit points you rolled. But whatever the adjustments, your hit points cannot be lowered to 0 (zero); you will have at least 1 hit point for each roll.

Each time a character gains a level of experience (a measure of how experienced he is), roll for more hitpoints. And each time you roll, you adjust the roll according to your Constitution score.

Eventually, your character will stop gaining dice of hit points every time he earns a level of experience, and will no longer gain bonuses for a very high or very low Constitution score. Instead, he'll start getting a pre-set number of hit points every level, and his Constitution bonus will not apply to that number. But that's off in the future; don't worry about it right now.

## Charisma

A character's Charisma score will affect how others, whether characters or monsters, react to

Whenever your character is talking to any creature (monster or character) controlled by the DM, tell the DM what your reaction adjustment is. If your Dungeon Master allows the use of retainers and you attempt to employ some, you will need to tell him your character's maximum number of retainers, as well as the Retainer Morale score (which is a measure of loyalty and courage). Reaction adjustments due to high Charisma never adjust any rolls you make; they only affect rolls made by the Dungeon Master, so he needs to know this information.

## Choose Character Alignment

Alignment is a code of behavior or way of life which guides the actions and thoughts of characters and monsters. There are three alignments in the D&D® game: Law, Chaos, and Neutrality.

Players may choose the alignments they feel will best fit their characters. A player does not have to tell other players what alignment he or she has picked, but must tell the Dungeon Master. Most Lawful characters will reveal their alignments if asked.

When picking alignments, the characters should know that Chaotics cannot be trusted, even by other Chaotics. A Chaotic character does not work well with other PCs.

Alignments give characters guidelines to live by. They are not absolute rules: characters will try to follow their alignment guidelines, but may not always be successful. To better understand the philosophies behind them, let's define the three alignments.

## Law (or Lawful)

Law is the belief that everything should follow an order, and that obeying rules is the natural way of life. Lawful creatures will try to tell the truth, obey laws that are fair, keep promises, and care for all living things.

If a choice must be made between the benefit of a group or an individual, a Lawful character will usually choose the group. Sometimes individual freedoms must be given up for the good

of the group. Lawful characters and monsters often act in predictable ways. Lawful behavior is usually the same as "good" behavior.

## Chaos (or Chaotic)

Chaos is the opposite of Law. It is the belief that life is random and that chance and luck rule the world. Laws are made to be broken, as long as a person can get away with it. It is not important to keep promises, and lying and telling the truth are both useful.

To a Chaotic creature, the individual is the most important of all things. Selfishness is the normal way of life, and the group is not important. Chaotics often act on sudden desires and whims. They have strong belief in the power of luck. They cannot always be trusted. Chaotic behavior is usually the same as behavior that could be called "evil." Each individual player must decide if his Chaotic character is closer to a mean, selfish "evil" personality or merely a happy-go-lucky, unpredictable personality.

## Neutrality (or Neutral)

Neutrality is the belief that the world is a balance between Law and Chaos. It is important that neither side get too much power and upset this balance. The individual is important, but so is the group; the two sides must work together.

A Neutral character is most interested in personal survival. Such characters believe in their own wits and abilities rather than luck. They tend to return the treatment they receive from others. Neutral characters will join a party if they think it is in their own best interest, but will not be overly helpful unless there is some sort of profit in it. Neutral behavior may be considered "good" or "evil" (or neither).

## Alignment Behavior

Take this situation as an example: A group of player characters is attacked by a large number of monsters. Escape is not possible unless the monsters are slowed down.

A *Lawful* character will fight to protect the group, regardless of the danger. The character will not run away unless the whole group does so or is otherwise safe.

A *Neutral* character will fight to protect the group as long as it is reasonably safe to do so. If the danger is too great, the character will try to save himself, even at the expense of the rest of the party.

A *Chaotic* character might fight the monsters or he might run away immediately—Chaotics are, as always, unpredictable. The character may not even care what happened to the rest of the party.

Playing an alignment does not mean a character must do stupid things. A character should always act as intelligently as the Intelligence score indicates, unless there is a reason to act otherwise (such as a magical curse).

## Alignment Languages

Each alignment has a secret language of passwords, hand signals, and other body motions. Player characters and intelligent monsters always know their alignment languages. They will also

recognize when another alignment language is being spoken, but will not understand it. Alignment languages have no written form. A character may not learn a different alignment language unless he changes alignments. In such a case, the character forgets the old alignment language and starts using the new one immediately.

## Select Name, Personality, and Background

You may have been thinking about this all during the character-creation process, but now it's time to give your character his name, personality, and background—the traits which make him a real character.

### Name

You should give your character a name appropriate to the world in which he'll be adventuring. Ask your DM if his campaign setting is based on any real-world civilization; if so, use a name appropriate to that civilization. (If you're not familiar with that civilization, ask your DM for help.) Or if you are adventuring in an Arabian setting, such legendary names as Ali Baba, Sinbad, and Saladin are appropriate names.

Many campaigns are straightforward fantasy with elements drawn from a number of sources, yet these campaigns may not be strongly based in any of those sources. In that case, you need merely make up a fantasy-sounding name and ask the DM if it sounds appropriate to his campaign. Such names can be made up of interesting-sounding syllables like Adragan or Nissia. Or, and especially in the case of lyrically named elves, they could be composed of descriptive words like Silverglade or Woodshadow.

Choose a name carefully. It should represent the character in some way, or at least be a name you like. You might find yourself playing this character for years, and if you give him a silly or inappropriate name, you might regret it later.

### Personality

Alignment isn't all there is to a character's personality. You should think about your character, about his mannerisms, the way he speaks, the way he dresses, how he spends money, what sort of people he likes, how he likes to spend his non-adventuring time, and so on. The more attention you invest in imagining your character, with all his traits, virtues, and vices, the more interesting and "real" you will make him. Sure, it's useful for your character to be the mightiest warrior in the world . . . but none of the other player characters will care whether he lives or dies unless he has a personality.

### Background

At some point, you'll need to decide on your character's background: where and when he was born, how he was reared, who his family is, who his friends were, and what he did up until the time he enters play.

This isn't a solo effort—it's a cooperative effort between you and the DM. He knows more

about his campaign-world than you do; you know more about your character than he does. The two of you have to work together to integrate your character into his world.

This means that the DM may recommend or even insist on some changes to your character background in order to make him fit better into the campaign world. You should normally accept any recommendations that don't seriously interfere with your concept of your character, and should negotiate on the ones which do.

For example, you may have decided that your character's family lived in a small fishing village in a small, distant island far, far away. Your DM may prefer that he lived in a small fishing village on the coast of the main continent, not quite so isolated. This probably won't alter your character's personality or personal history, and will allow your DM to fit your character more easily into the campaign, so this is the sort of change you can acquiesce to without any worries.

But let's say your DM wants to establish something else about your character: That when he was ten, a werewolf with a distinctive red-and-silver coat burst in through the door of the family hut and killed all the family except your character, and that your character was raised by the family of your mother's brother.

It's obvious here that your DM is setting you up for some future encounter with that selfsame werewolf—perhaps it will be far in the future, or perhaps the hunt for that monster will be used as the event which will bring all the player characters together in the first place. Whichever, he's not trying to kill your character's family for frivolous reasons, but for reasons related to plot.

However, you've been imagining that your character is emotionally strong and unscarred, and still has a good relationship with his parents and siblings, and the DM's changes would seriously affect your concept of your character. You explain this to him. This is where negotiations enter the picture.

He may counter, "All right, let's say instead that the werewolf attacked the local pub, and your father was among those killed. As the oldest son, you suddenly had to become the man of the family, and now, after you've been the main provider for years, your brothers and sisters are old enough to take over, and you can leave to make a life for yourself at last."

This still leaves your character with a tragedy in his past, but he didn't lose his entire family, and wasn't present to see his father destroyed by the monster, which would tend to leave him much healthier emotionally. So you could agree to this change, and both your purposes and your DM's are served.

Another thing you can do, and your DM may be doing so as well, is to establish that your character already knows some of the other player characters. Talk with the other players to find out something about their characters. When the players have come up with similar backgrounds, you might suggest that those backgrounds intersected with yours, and then try to work out the details. Perhaps another player thought of his character as growing up in a fishing village, in which case you might suggest that it be the same as your character's. Perhaps another character has been in the army, and you conceived of your character as having briefly been a soldier. See if

# Chapter 1: Steps in Character Creation

you can put your character in the same unit.

This sort of thing helps establish connections between your characters. These connections can keep an adventuring group from falling apart over trivial incidents of mistrust and confusion.

## Determine Character Height and Weight

The player can choose any height and weight for his character which the DM agrees is appropriate. The Character Height and Weight Table will give you an idea what height and weight ranges are *average* for character races. For use with later encumbrance rules, all character weights are given in coin-weights: one coin equals one-tenth of a pound, so a character weighing 2,000 en actually weighs 200 lbs.

## Earn Experience

As characters go through a lot of adventures, they gradually get better and better at what they do. Everyone learns to fight better (especially fighters). Everyone learns to withstand damage better (more hit points and better saving throws), and so forth. This is all accomplished through the use of experience points and experience levels.

At the end of every game-session or complete adventure story (the DM will decide which), the Dungeon Master will award experience points (abbreviated as "XP") to the characters. Experience points are awarded for accomplishing goals in the course of the adventure story.

Every so often, a character will have earned enough experience points to attain a higher experience level; this is often referred to as "going up a level." Each time the character goes up a level, he gains more abilities. *Under no circumstances* can a character advance more than one level per adventure; all experience beyond one level of advancement can be *retained* up to one point short of a two level advance. Any additional experience is lost.

Take a look at the Fighter Experience Table on page 16, then return here.

As you can see on that table, a fighter with no experience points (0 XP) is a 1st level fighter. During his adventuring career, he'll earn experience points. Once he reaches 2,000 points, his player should inform the DM that he's reached his 2nd experience level; once he reaches 4,000 experience points, he can tell the DM that he's reached 3rd level; and so on.

The number of experience points the character must earn becomes proportionately greater and greater. Don't be alarmed by this. The character's rise through experience levels will slow down, but not as much as this table suggests. As he becomes tougher, he can undertake tougher and tougher quests, which will earn him proportionately more experience points.

## Hit Dice and Hit Points

After a character reaches 9th experience level (often referred to as "Name" level), the player no longer rolls dice to gain additional hit points for the character. For each level of experience earned, a given number of hit points (instead of Hit Dice) will be gained. The number of hit points gained each level (after 9th) will be shown later in the next chapter; it differs from character class to character class.

Each player will roll Hit Dice for his character from 1st experience level to 9th (or 8th, in the case of the halfling character, who can only go up to 8th level). Starting with 10th level, the character will receive a pre-set number of hit points appropriate for his character class.

Constitution adjustments to hit points apply only to the Hit Dice the player rolls; they do not apply to the hit points added at higher levels.

### Maximum Levels and Experience Points

Dwarves and elves may not progress beyond 12th level. Halflings may only rise to 8th level. Druids may only achieve 30th level (and only then after a special challenge, which is described in the next chapter), while mystics can only reach 16th level. The other four human classes (cleric, fighter, magic-user, thief) may continue all the way to 36th level.

Once a character reaches his maximum experience level, he does *not* stop earning experience points. Characters can always earn more experience points. Players should keep records of all the experience points their characters earn.

## Prime Requisites and Experience Points

If your character's prime requisite is high enough, he will get extra experience points. The Experience Bonuses and Penalties Table will serve as your rule of thumb for calculating how much extra experience clerics, fighters, magicians, and thieves get for high prime requisites.

### Experience Bonuses and Penalties Table

| Class      | Prime Requisite and<br>Experience Bonus |

| Halfling   | Str 13-18 or Dex 13-18: +5%             |
|            | Str 13-18 and Dex 13-18: +10%           |
| Druid      | Wis 3-5: -20%                           |
|            | Wis 6-8: -10%                           |
|            | Wis 13-15: +5%                          |
|            | Wis 16-18: +10%                         |
| Mystic     | Str 3-5: -10%                           |
|            | Str 6-8: -5%                            |
|            | Str 13-15: +5%                          |
|            | Str 16-18: +10%                         |

For example, a fighter's prime requisite is Strength. If he has a Strength of 3-5, he loses 20% of all the experience points he earns. If he has a Strength of 6-8, he loses 10%. If his Strength is 13-15, he earns an *extra* 5%. And if his Strength is 16-18, he earns an extra 10%.

If a fighter with a Strength of 16 were to be given 100 points of experience, his player would add in an extra 10% (for a total of 110 experience points) before writing the amount down on his character sheet.

### Calculating Experience Bonuses

Unless your DM tells you otherwise, you will always calculate your character's experience bonus... or experience penalty. However, some DMs prefer to keep a close eye on characters' experience gains, and may decide to calculate all such bonuses themselves. In such a case, the DM needs to tell his players about this decision ahead of time; otherwise they might accidentally add in their experience bonuses again.

## Chapter 2: The Character Classes

![Decorative floral border]()![](_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

One character professions, or "character classes," are described below. They include the Your basic human classes (cleric, fighter, magic-user, thief), the three demihuman classes (dwarf, elf, halfing), and two special human classes (druid, mystic).

Each character class is presented in the following fashion.

**Boxed Material:** This box shows abbreviated information about the character class for players who are already familiar with the game and only need to be reminded of certain details.

**Description:** The class is described in terms of the traits, goals, and abilities common to all members of the profession or race.

**Experience Table:** This table shows the maximum experience level a member of this character class can attain, the number of experience points it takes to achieve each experience level, and the number of magical spells the character acquires at each level (in the case of spellcasting character classes).

**Saving Throws Table:** This table shows the character's saving throws at every experience level the character can attain.

**Class Details:** This text talks about many of the class' special characteristics: its prime requisite, its Hit Dice, restrictions or advantages with armor and weapons, and any other significant details.

**Special Abilities:** This text talks about any special abilities which the character class possesses. Some classes can cast magical spells; some can see in the dark; some have no special abilities at all. Some special abilities will require tables and tables of their own.

**At Higher Experience Levels:** Finally, this text describes special characteristics and responsibilities the character acquires when he reaches higher levels of experience.

### Understanding the Tables

Take a look at any of the experience tables in the following pages. Here's an explanation of those tables' column headings.

**Level:** This column shows the experience levels which characters of this class can attain. Most human classes can reach 36th level; some classes are more restricted.

**XP:** This column shows the number of experience points it takes for the character to attain each experience level. A starting character has 0 experience points and is at 1st level.

**Attack Rank:** Not all experience tables will have this column; only the demihuman tables have it. Attack ranks are measures of a demihuman's ability to improve his fighting skills even when he's reached his maximum experience level. Each attack rank corresponds to a fighter's experience level when you determine how well the demihuman hits in combat; see the Attack Rolls Table on page 106 to see how well demihumans attack at different attack ranks.

**Spells/Level:** Not all experience tables will have this column—only the tables belonging to spellcasting character classes. As you'll see in Chapter 3, spells are arranged in levels—just as there are 1st level characters, there are 1st level spells, for instance. The table shows how many spells of which spell level a character can know.

### About the Classes

Here are some notes on the three categories of character classes—humans, demihumans, and special—before you progress on to the actual class descriptions.

#### Human Classes

In the D&D® game, humans are the most prolific race. They are also the race with the greatest potential. While demihuman character classes can only attain moderate experience levels (8th, 10th, or 12th level, depending on the class/race), each of the four basic human character classes can attain 36th experience level.

In many D&D game campaigns, human civilization is similar to the civilizations of Western Europe in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance period. In such campaigns, you can expect to see most humans living in kingdoms ruled by a king and queen and organized in feudal fiefdoms, with a rising middle class of traders and craftsmen in the cities.

However, your Dungeon Master may decide not to follow that standard; he may prefer for his human civilizations to resemble ancient Egypt, feudal Japan, conquistador-era Mexico, a culture from a specific fantasy novel, or something created from his own imagination. Be sure to ask your Dungeon Master about the nature of human cultures in his world; the more you know ahead of time, the better you can fit your character into the existing setting.

#### Demihuman Classes

Demihuman characters are more limited than human characters. They can't rise to very high levels of experience (dwarves are limited to 12th level, elves to 10th, halfings to 8th). Elves cannot learn very powerful magic; they can only learn up to 5th level spells, while humans can learn up to 9th level spells.

**Clans:** The demihuman race of dwarves, elves, and halfings have a different way of life than humans. They usually live longer, have a stricter way of life, and find security in large family groups called Clans. A Clan may include several hundred demihumans. The head of the Clan is always the oldest member, male or female, assuming that member is fit to rule.

Day-to-day tasks are usually done by those best suited to do them. Unlike many human communities, few demihumans are lazy; everyone has a job, with Clan duties and responsibilities, and "goofing off" is nearly unthinkable. The DM may choose to develop many other aspects of demihuman family life (such as marriage customs, industry, clan-to-clan relations, and so forth) as needed.

**Demihuman Relations:** Elves and dwarves don't usually like each other. This dislike usually surfaces as verbal battles, rather than physical. Both get along fairly well with halfings.

The DM will decide why elves and dwarves don't get along in his own campaign. In the D&D game's Known World setting, it's because they are so physically and emotionally different (elves are tall and willowy, dwarves short and stocky; elves love freedom and the outdoors, dwarves love organization and caverns, etc.), and because the two races had many clashes in the past for which they've never forgiven one an-

other. But the reason can be different in your own campaign; a DM can decide, for instance, that in his own world the elves and dwarves are the best of friends!

All demihuman races trade and interact with humans; though men can be dangerous, many are also trustworthy and have good points.

**Special Abilities and Maneuvers:** All demihuman races receive special abilities, which make them much more effective than humans in certain situations. The special abilities of each race are detailed in the description of each character class.

#### Special Classes

There are two other human character classes, the druid and the mystic, which are described separately from the cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief. We present them separately because the DM may not wish to include them in his campaign.

The druid is a little complicated, because druid characters start play as clerics and then change their character classes to become druids.

The mystic, a monastic specialist in unarmed combat, is not appropriate for all campaigns. Some of their special abilities mimic those of other human classes, but many are unique to this class, including their increasingly powerful unarmed combat tactics.

### Cleric

#### Prime Requisite: Wisdom.

**Experience Bonus:** 5% for Wisdom 13-15, 10% for Wisdom 16-18.

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level up to 9th level. Starting with 10th level, +1 hit point per level, and Constitution adjustments no longer apply.

#### Maximum Level: 36.

**Armor:** Any, plus shield.

**Weapons:** No edged or pointed weapons; all others permitted.

**Special Abilities:** Turning undead; clerical spells.

A cleric is a human character who is dedicated to serving a great and worthy cause. This cause can be an Immortal being dedicated to a specific goal or attribute; sometimes the cleric is serving only his alignment, and has no interest in immortal beings. The D&D game does *not* deal with the ethical and theological beliefs of the characters in the game.

All clerics belong to *orders*, or clerical societies, made up of clerics serving the same ends. A brand-new cleric organization is at the very bottom of his clerical organization; as he gains experience levels, he will also gain new powers and responsibilities pertaining to his clerical order. The DM will decide, and will inform you, how the clerical orders of his campaign are arranged.

A cleric can learn to cast spells after gaining a level of experience. A 1st level cleric *cannot* cast any spells; once he reaches 2nd level, he can begin to cast spells. A cleric's spell powers come from the strength of the cleric's beliefs. The cleric sits and meditates, and magically learns spells. These spells can then be used during an adventure. Most clerical spells are for healing, protec-

tion, and gathering information. Clerical spells are different from magic-user spells. Clerics can use *only* their own type of spells; they never utilize magic-user spells.

Clerics have good fighting skills and can fight monsters. A cleric can wear any type of armor, like a fighter; he can use many types of weapons, but cannot use edged or piercing weapons of any sort. Unlike magic-users, whose spells are often used during battles, a cleric's spells are usually needed after battles (such as cures) or for general exploring (such as detecting things).

If your party has enough fighters, your cleric should not need to fight often. But he is equipped for fighting if his combat skill is needed. Watch for ways that his spells can help before, during, and after battles.

For the first three levels of experience, a cleric's power is very limited. But as they advance (to a maximum of 36th level), clerics obtain more spells of greater power, due both to practice and

the strengthening of their beliefs.

It is very important for clerics to be faithful to their beliefs. If a cleric behaves in a manner that is not consistent with the character's alignment or beliefs, the cleric may be punished by the order—or by even greater powers. This punishment could be a penalty on attack rolls, a dangerous quest that must be completed, or even a lack of spells. The DM will tell you what the character must do to regain his good standing.

### Class Details

Prime Requisite: A cleric's prime requisite is Wisdom. If a cleric has a Wisdom score of 13-15, the character gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned in every adventure; if his Wisdom is 16-18, he earns a 10% bonus to XP.

Hit Dice: Roll a six-sided die (1d6) to determine a cleric's hit points. A cleric starts with 1d6 (1-6) hit points (plus any Constitution bonus)

and gains 1d6 more hit points (plus bonus) with each level of experience. One additional hit point is gained for each level after 9th level.

Armor: A cleric can wear any kind of armor, and can use a shield.

Weapons: A cleric cannot use any weapon with a sharp edge or point; this is forbidden by the cleric's beliefs. This includes arrows and quarrels. But the cleric can use any non-edged weapon.

### Special Abilities

A cleric has two special abilities: turning undead monsters and casting clerical spells.

#### Turning Undead

A cleric has the power to force certain monsters called the "undead" (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, wights, and other types) to run away, or even to perish. This special ability is called "turning undead."

When a cleric encounters an undead monster, the cleric may either attack it normally (with a weapon or spell), or try to turn it. The cleric cannot both attack and turn undead in one round.

When you want your cleric to try to turn undead, just tell your Dungeon Master "I'll try to turn undead this round." The power to turn undead is inherent in the cleric; he does not need the symbol of his faith or any other device to do it, unless the DM declares otherwise.

Undead monsters are not automatically turned by the cleric. When the encounter occurs, the player must refer to the cleric's Turning Undead table to find the effect the cleric has.

When the cleric tries to turn an undead monster, find the cleric's level of experience across the top of the table. Read down the left column until you find the name of the undead monster.

If you see a "—" in the column, then you cannot turn the monster. If you see anything else, you have a chance to turn the monster, or perhaps several monsters. See immediately below, under "Explanation of Results," to learn how to find out if you have turned the monster.

Apply the results immediately. If the attempt succeeds, one or more of the undead monsters will retreat or be destroyed. But don't forget, if the monster is turned, it hasn't been destroyed; it may decide to return soon. . . .

If you try to turn a specific undead monster (for instance, one specific vampire) and fail, you cannot try again to turn it in the same fight. At some later encounter, you can try to turn that individual again.

#### Explanation of Results

7, 9, or 11: Whenever a number is listed, the cleric has a chance to turn the undead monsters. The player rolls 2d6 (two six-sided dice). If the total is equal to or greater than the number given, the attempt at turning undead is successful.

When the attempt at turning undead is successful, the Dungeon Master (not the player) will roll 2d6 to determine the number of Hit Dice of undead monsters that turn away. At least one monster will be turned, regardless of what the DM rolls on his dice.

Example: A 1st level cleric has just encountered a group of seven zombies. Zombies (as you

can learn in Chapter 14) each have two Hit Dice (2 HD). The cleric tries to turn the zombies.

On the Turning Undead Table, a 1st level cleric vs. a zombie yields a result of 9: The cleric must roll a 9 or greater on 2d6 to turn the zombies. The cleric's player rolls 2d6 and achieves a 10—he has successfully turned undead.

The DM now rolls to see what sort of results the cleric achieves. He rolls 2d6 and achieves an 8; in other words, the cleric turns 8 Hit Dice of

zombies. Since each zombie is a 2-Hit Die creature, the cleric has turned four zombies. Four zombies turn and begin shambling away from the cleric as fast as they can move. This leaves the cleric with only three to fight. Next round, he can attack them with weapons or spells, or he can try to turn them, too.

T: The attempt at turning the undead automatically succeeds; the cleric's player does not need to roll for success. To determine how many

undead will be turned, the DM rolls 2d6 as described above; regardless of his roll, at least one undead will be turned.

D: The attempt at turning the undead automatically succeeds—in fact, it succeeds so well that the affected monsters are *destroyed* instead of merely turned. To determine how many Hit Dice of undead will be destroyed, the DM rolls 2d6 as described above; regardless of his roll, at least one undead will be destroyed. (The DM decides what happens when the monsters are destroyed: They might fade away, burst into flame and crumble away, or disintegrate like a vampire in sunlight, for instance.)

D+: This is the same as the "D" result above, except that the DM rolls 3d6 to find out how many Hit Dice of undead will be destroyed. Regardless of the roll, at least one undead will be destroyed.

D#: This is the same as the "D" result above, except that the DM rolls 4d6 to find out how many Hit Dice of undead will be destroyed. Regardless of the roll, at least one undead will be destroyed.

### Using Clerical Spells

Starting at the 2nd level of experience (having earned 1,500 XP or more), the cleric can use spells. The procedures by which the cleric learns and casts his spells are described in Chapter 3.

## Higher Experience Levels

When a cleric reaches *Name* level (9th), he is called a patriarch (if male) or matriarch (if female). At this point in his adventuring career, he has several options available to him.

If the character is a Neutral cleric, he can decide to become a druid instead (see the description of that character class below); he certainly does not *have* to change his class.

If the cleric is a Neutral who does not want to become a druid, or if he is Lawful or Chaotic alignment, he must decide whether to build a clerical stronghold approved by his clerical order.

Depending on how the DM has set up his campaign, the cleric might have built himself a

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_15_Picture_2.jpeg)

home, even a lavish castle, long before. However, that was his *personal* home, regardless of how big it is or what he has done with it. Here, we're talking about a stronghold sanctioned by the cleric's order, one which will be built and maintained to further the goals of the order.

### Land-Owning Clerics

A cleric who decides to build a stronghold with the sanction of his clerical order is called a "land-owning cleric." (Note: This is merely a convenient term. A land-owning cleric can go adventuring with his footloose friends; he is not tied to his land.) There are advantages and disadvantages to setting up a clerical stronghold.

**Advantages:** The character can progress up through the ranks of his clerical order. The character may receive financial aid from his order toward the building of the stronghold. The character may be able to increase his lands and build strong settlements there, which could result in him becoming a very wealthy character indeed.

**Disadvantages:** The character will be the chief clerical authority (for his clerical order) for the lands around his stronghold. This means that he has clerical responsibilities to all the people living on and around his lands—responsibilities which may interfere with his desire to travel with his old adventuring friends or which may confront him with difficult problems.

### Traveling Clerics

A cleric who decides not to build a stronghold sanctioned by his order is referred to as a "traveling cleric," even if he is not always on the road traveling. There are also advantages and disadvantages to being a traveling cleric.

**Advantages:** The cleric does not have to tie himself down to any one place or group of people; except when acting on official requests from his order, he may go where he pleases.

**Disadvantages:** The cleric may not rise to or above the rank of a land-owning cleric, and may not achieve much political influence within his order. (He doesn't stop earning experience points, experience levels, or personal power; he just cannot climb any higher in the clerical order's hierarchy.) The cleric still has responsibilities to his clerical order, naturally; as before, he may be required at any time to uphold the beliefs and accomplish the goals of his order.

### Becoming a Land Owner

If the 9th level cleric decides to build a stronghold, he must report to a superior of some type, either an official of his order or a ruler of the nation where he wishes to settle, to ask for land. This ruler should willingly grant the land, unless the cleric has had problems with him in the past; if so, the ruler may require some service of the cleric (such as a *quest*) before he grants the land. (The DM must decide whether the cleric's order has the power to make such grants, according to the civilization of his campaign world.)

If the cleric has never been punished for misbehavior, either by his order or by the powers that grant him his spells, his order can (at the DM's discretion) help him with the cost of building the stronghold. Such help usually involves the order paying for up to any amount the DM feels to be reasonable (the standard is 50% of the stronghold's construction). The player

should design the stronghold the way he wishes to see it built. The DM will calculate how much it would cost to build, determine to his own satisfaction how much of the design is good and necessary planning (and how much is extravagant overexpenditure), and decide what proportion of the cost the clerical order will assume.

Regardless of how much the clerical order pays, the stronghold is technically the cleric's property. The cleric can't deny access to the property and its facilities to members of his order—normally, he shouldn't ever *wish* to do so—but it's his land, and he can't just be assigned to some other stronghold against his will.

A number (typically 1d6) of lower level clerics will come to the stronghold once it is built, to assist and serve the cleric in operating the stronghold's clerical functions. (See Chapter 11 for more on this.) Naturally, he'll get fewer or *no* assistant clerics if he has a reputation for abusing or endangering his retainers. These clerics have arrived with the intention of helping to operate the stronghold, not to travel with the cleric on his adventures. The DM should create each of these clerics as an individual, with his own name, personality, background, goals, and abilities.

If the cleric manages his land well and serves his order equally well, he will probably rise in power in the bureaucracy of his clerical order. In addition, he may be awarded more land; more normal men will settle the area around the cleric's stronghold, and the cleric will receive more tax income from the settlements.

#### Choosing to Travel

A cleric who decides to travel may follow one of two routes: in civilized lands, or in wilderness.

A cleric who travels within the boundaries of the civilized world usually looks for ways to help those of the same alignment (whatever that may be). The cleric may travel alone, with retainers, or with other clerics.

A cleric who travels to the wilderness usually searches for enemies of the clerical order, to convert or destroy. This cleric normally travels with other characters as an adventuring party (though the others may all be NPCs).

#### Changing Back and Forth

Once a player decides to be a traveling or land-owning cleric, only a major development in the campaign or in the character should change that status. The DM should discourage frequent or casual changes of the cleric's status.

Prime Requisite: Strength.

Experience Bonus: 5% for Strength 13-15, 10% for Strength 16-18.

Options (see Chapter 8).

A fighter is a human whose main ability is fighting skill. Fighters often have greater Strength than other characters. They usually hit opponents more often in combat, and inflict more damage.

In the D&D® game, fighters protect their weaker friends and allies. A party made up only of fighters would probably survive most dungeon and wilderness encounters, even those where magic would be useful. Every group of explorers should have at least one or two fighters.

In group adventures, the fighters should stay in front and act as the "front line" in combat situations. If there are three or more fighters in the party, one should stay in the back, in case the characters' party is approached from the rear by enemies. In battle itself, fighters have a better chance at surviving physical damage, since they have more hit points than most other classes.

A fighter character should be able to use a variety of weapons. Unless your conception of your fighter character limits him to one class of weapons, you should equip him with both hand-to-hand and missile weapons.

Fighters may advance as high as 36th level. Their rapid advances, both in combat ability and in their amount of hit points, make them natural leaders in human settlements, especially small ones. High level fighters spend a lot of their time training and leading men-at-arms, clearing the wilderness of monsters, and expanding human settlements.

## Class Details

Prime Requisite: A fighter's prime requisite is Strength. If a fighter has a Strength score of 13-15 or more, the character gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned in every adventure; if his Strength is 16-18, his bonus is 10%.

Hit Dice: Roll an 8-sided die (1d8) to determine a fighter's hit points. A fighter starts with 1d8 (1-8) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d8 more hit points (plus bonus) with each level of experience. Two additional hit points are gained for each level after 9th level.

Armor: A fighter can wear any kind of armor and may use a shield.

Weapons: A fighter can use any kind of weapon.

## Special Abilities

Beginning fighters initially receive only a couple of special abilities and need no other special abilities to survive and prosper. Their great strength, hit points, strong armor, and many weapons make them a powerful character class without additional special abilities. At higher experience levels, though, they do receive some additional fighting abilities.

The two special abilities they do receive immediately are the Lance Attack maneuver and Set Spear vs. Charge maneuver. These maneuvers are described in Chapter 8.

At higher experience levels, some fighters receive specific special abilities, including Fighter Combat Options and other abilities; these are also described in Chapter 8.

## Higher Experience Levels

A fighter with enough money may build himself a home, even a castle, before he reaches 9th experience level. However, this home has no official sanction; even if it is a castle, the character is not a ruler or a nobleman.

When a fighter reaches Name level (9th level), the character is, owing to his great abilities and reputation, addressed as Lord (if male) or Lady (if female). This is status within his community even if it is not a formal title; it is for the DM to decide whether or not it is a formal title bestowed upon the fighter by the nation's rulers.

At Name level, the fighter will have to decide whether he intends to be a "land-owning fighter" (i.e., a ruler in his own right, and lord of a region of land) or a "traveling fighter" (one who may own homes but not rule land, and has no especially strong responsibilities to the nation's rulers). Don't be confused by these names. A land-owning fighter may spend a lot of time traveling and adventuring, and a traveling fighter may spend a lot of his time at home.

![Illustration of a knight in full armor, holding a sword and a shield, ready for combat.]()![](_page_16_Picture_14.jpeg)

### Land-Owning Fighters

There are two ways for a fighter to become a land-owning fighter: independently or in fealty to a greater ruler.

The DM decides on what sort of government is used in his campaign. Assuming that it's based on medieval Europe, as is the case with many D&D® game campaigns, a nation's government consists in part of a king and queen ruling a strong court of dukes, counts and barons, each of whom rules a smaller territory or fiefdom.

In order to become a ruler within an existing country, he will have to petition the country's rulers for a grant of land. If he has already done them great services in the past, they may give it to him immediately and gratefully, but if he is not already their friend or ally, they may send him on a difficult quest so that he can prove himself to them. Once he has been granted the land, he may build his castle upon it (at his own expense). The land may be occupied or not; if it is unoccupied, the prospective ruler had best try to lure settlers there soon, so that his dominion will begin receiving tax revenues.

At the very least, a land-owning fighter within an existing country will be granted the title of Baron (if male) or Baroness (if female), or the equivalent. If he continues to expand his land within the nation's laws and to make his dominion an increasingly strong and rich one, he may receive greater titles, such as Count, Countess and Duke/Duchess.

If the fighter wishes to make his dominion in a wilderness which is not within an existing country, he may call himself anything he wants—baron, duke, king, emperor. However, be aware that a too-glorious title will make others laugh at him. If he takes a title, it should be appropriate to the size and strength of the dominion he is ruling; he may wish to change his title as it increases in size and prosperity.

### Traveling Fighters

If, at 9th level, a fighter does not decide to make a dominion for himself, he chooses to become a traveling fighter (you can use the term even if he really doesn't do a lot of traveling). Traveling fighters don't usually have the political

power that land-owning fighters do, but they can receive special abilities to help compensate for that. (Note that we said can. They don't receive these abilities automatically.)

The alignment of a traveling fighter determines special abilities and other characteristics.

### Paladins

A *Lawful traveling fighter* may be known as a paladin if he meets the following requirements. If he does not meet those requirements, he may become a knight (described below).

1. The fighter must swear fealty (an oath of service) to a Lawful clerical order to gain paladin status. The fighter must be of Name level or greater to be accepted by the clerical order. Thereafter, the paladin may be summoned by the order's leaders at any time, and must do as they command, as long as the service aids the powers of Good.
2. A paladin can *detect evil* (as per the cleric spell) as often as once per round, simply by concentrating. (Range: 120'. The paladin cannot use this ability and attack in the same round.)
3. If the paladin's Wisdom score is 13 or greater, the character can cast cleric spells as if he were a cleric of one-third his actual experience level (round any fraction down); if a fighter becomes a paladin right at 9th level, he'll immediately gain the spells of a 3rd level cleric. A 17th level paladin can cast spells as if he were a 5th level cleric. If his Wisdom score is 12 or less, the fighter can still be a paladin, but cannot cast spells.
4. The paladin learns how to meditate and cast spells from the clerics of the order. The clerics will refuse any offer of compensation or payment for this service.
5. A paladin can *turn undead*, as if he were a cleric of one-third his actual experience level (round all fractions down). Therefore, a 6th or 7th level paladin can turn undead with the same ability of a 2nd level cleric.
6. A paladin may only travel with a number of hirelings equal to or less than his clerical level. In other words, if he can cast spells or turn undead as a 5th level cleric, he can have five hirelings accompany him.
7. A paladin must assist anyone who asks for help—with two exceptions: He does not have to help evil characters or achieve evil goals, and if the paladin is on a mission for a higher authority (such as a quest, serving a duke, etc.), he can offer only a small amount of help (such as sheltering or advising the person in need of aid), along with an explanation for his refusal. Assistance never involves donations of money or items, but only service for a short time.

### Knights

A *Neutral traveling fighter* may become a knight. Lawful traveling fighters who do not become paladins, or Chaotic traveling fighters who do not become an avengers (described below) are also able to become knights.

To gain knighthood, a fighter must swear fealty to a prince, king, or emperor. In return, the ruler will declare the character a knight; that ruler then becomes the knight's "liege."

In most campaigns, knights are the most common sort of traveling fighters. The following rules apply to knights.

1. If summoned by his liege the knight must report to him as quickly as possible, and must serve as the liege orders.
2. If the knight ever refuses to obey the liege, or ever swears fealty to any other liege, the knight loses three levels of experience. (The DM may increase this penalty if the offense warrants it.) The previous liege may even order the offender slain for his treachery. In addition, rumors and tales of the "traitorous knight" may haunt the character forever after; the character may find it difficult to find help in places where his reputation is known.

If his liege dies, the knight is free to choose another. Additional benefits (lands, money, etc.) may be awarded to knights who swear fealty to the successor of a liege who dies.

A knight may petition the liege for a peaceful end to his oath; however rarely granted. The knight would be banished, at the least, and could be stripped of all possessions as well.

1. A knight may visit any castle, of any territory, and request sanctuary. The castle owner must, by the customs of the land, give the knight a place to stay for up to three days, along with food and drink. He does not have to be friendly to the knight, but, according to this custom, may not challenge, attack, or refuse sanctuary to the knight. (Note that the knight cannot challenge or attack his host or members of his host's court or family, either. Should he do so, his sanctuary is at an end, and his host is now free to punish him.) In campaigns modeled after medieval Europe, this custom is nearly universal, but the DM is free to indicate that the custom is not present if his nations are not similar to Europe's.
2. If a *call to arms* sounds (a call for knights to battle for justice), the knight must respond. This declaration can only be issued by the ruler of a large town (Mayor) or territory (Archduke or greater status), and the knight need only respond if it sounds in the area through which he is passing or if it is called by his liege. When the call to arms sounds, the knight must immediately travel as fast as possible to the ruling castle of the one who made the call to arms, and fight as ordered by the ruler—within the constraints of any knightly oaths he took in the course of the campaign. (If the ruler who made the call to arms orders him to kill innocents or helpless prisoners, the knight may choose to refuse, but he will make an enemy of that ruler.) The knight is entitled to compensation for this service; the ruler issuing the call to arms must grant the knight a gift appropriate to the value of the knight's services. (Many rulers will offer the gift out of gratitude; some will not. The knight has the right to demand the gift; he does not have to demand it if he does not wish to.)

There are two notable exceptions to the custom of the call to arms. In lands where the civilization is very different from medieval Europe, this custom might not be used (in wilderness areas where there are no rulers, it

would naturally be unknown). If the knight is within a territory that has declared itself hostile to the knight's liege, the knight need not respond—if the call to arms is against the land of his liege, he *must not* respond. In fact, the knight would be in great danger when the call to arms sounds.

### Avengers

A *Chaotic traveling fighter* may become an avenger if he meets the following requirements. Otherwise, a Chaotic traveling fighter may also become a knight.

1. The fighter must make an alliance with a Chaotic clerical order. This is *not* a swearing an oath of fealty, but a loose agreement of loyalty and support; the order may decline the offer. If the order accepts, the order's leaders may summon the avenger at any time, and he must do as they command. If he disobeys them, he loses all special abilities and benefits of the avenger. Even then, the fighter may regain avenger status by negotiating with a different order.
2. An avenger can *detect evil* (as the cleric spell) up to once per round, simply by concentrating. (Range: 120'. The avenger may not use this ability and attack in the same round.)
3. If the avenger's Wisdom score is 13 or greater, the avenger can learn to cast cleric spells as if he were a cleric of one-third his actual experience level (round all fractions down). Therefore, a 12th/14th level avenger casts spells as a 4th level cleric. If his Wisdom score is 12 or less, the fighter can still be an avenger, but cannot cast spells.

The avenger learns how to meditate and cast spells from the clerics of the order—but at a price (the price is at the DM's discretion, but a minimum of 10,000 gp per clerical spell level gained is recommended).

1. An avenger may turn *undead* as if he were a cleric of one-third his actual experience level, but with an important difference. If the result is "turn" or "destroy," the avenger may choose to control them instead. If control is chosen, it lasts for 1 turn per level of the avenger—thus, a 17th level avenger could control them for 17 turns. Undead thus controlled behave as if *charmed*, obeying the avenger as if they were friends.

However, if the undead are turned or destroyed by a cleric during the duration of the control, the control is dispelled immediately, and cannot be renewed. If the duration of the control ends without incident, the undead will flee (as if turned).

1. An avenger may not have human or demi-human hirelings. However, the avenger may try to *persuade* monsters of Chaotic alignment to become his hirelings. If a Chaotic creature is not immediately hostile, the avenger may offer food or treasure, indicating (through word or gestures) friendship. If this fails, threats or combat resulting in surrender may accomplish nearly the same result. If the creature's Reaction roll indicates friendship, the creature is *persuaded* to follow and obey the avenger. The effect lasts for a duration identical to a *charm* magic-user spell; once it ends, it cannot be renewed. The

## Chapter 2: The Character Classes

avenger may have the number of Chaotic monster hirelings that his Charisma score allows for; once he loses one, he may try to persuade another.

6. An avenger may visit any castle, ruin, or dungeon known to be ruled by an intelligent Chaotic monster or character and, using his alignment tongue, demand Sanctuary (see knight, above). An avenger may pretend to be a knight and request Sanctuary of other rulers; if he deceives the ruler (and is not tripped up by some alignment-revealing magic), the ruler will provide him with normal Sanctuary.

### Changing Back and Forth

Once a player decides to be a traveling or land-owning fighter, only a major development in the campaign or in the character should change that status. The DM should discourage frequent or casual changes of the fighter's status.

## Magic-User

Prime Requisite: Intelligence.

Experience Bonus: 5% for Intelligence 13-15, 10% for Intelligence 16-18.

Hit Dice: 1d4 per level up to 9th level.  
Starting with 10th level, +1 hit point per level, and Constitution adjustments no longer apply.

Maximum Level: 36.

Armor: None; no shield permitted.

Weapons: Dagger only. Optional (DM's discretion): staff, blowgun, flaming oil, holy water, net, thrown rock, sling, whip.

Special Abilities: Magical spells.

A magic-user is a human character who studies the powers of magic. Magic-users find spells, put them into books, and study those books to learn the spells. Magic-users have their own spells, entirely different from clerical spells. A magic-user has poor fighting skills, and should avoid combat.

A magic-user concentrates on learning and casting magic spells. He'll find that a high Intelligence is very helpful. The magic-user's other ability scores are often low. However, a high Constitution score will help your magic-user survive longer, because it gives a bonus to hit points—one of the magic-user's weaker traits.

Magic-users greatly fear damage. All the other character classes can use armor of some kind, but magic-users can only wear clothes. Thus, they are easy to hit. They also have few hit points.

Magic-users start as the weakest characters, but can eventually become the most powerful. Their magical spells can be used for many things—from simple things like opening doors and locks, to impressive and dangerous magical attacks such as throwing lightning. All details on spellcasting are given in Chapter 3.

However, it is often difficult for magic-users to survive. Their few weapons and spells (at low levels) balance against the power they eventually achieve. Therefore, magic-users must be cautious at lower levels, as few will survive long without protection.

Your magic-user should not go on adventures alone; because of his low defenses and hit points, one surprise could kill him. In groups, he should always stay in the middle of the party, protected from attacks, and use his magic in ways that will help win the fight.

### Class Details

Prime Requisite: A magic-user's prime requisite is Intelligence. If a magic-user has an Intelligence score of 13-15, the character gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned in every adventure; if he has an Intelligence of 16-18, the bonus is 10%.

Hit Dice: Roll a 4-sided die (1d4) to determine a magic-user's hit points. A magic-user starts with 1d4 (1-4) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d4 more hit points

(plus bonus) with each level of experience. One additional hit point is gained for each level after 9th level.

Armor: A magic-user cannot wear any kind of armor, and cannot use a shield.

Weapons: A magic-user may only use daggers as weapons. Optionally, at the DM's discretion, magic-users can use the staff, blowgun, flaming oil, holy water, net, thrown rock, sling, and whip.

### Special Abilities

The magic-user's sole special ability is that he can cast magic spells. The processes of spell book and new spell acquisitions, as well as how the magic-user memorizes and casts spells, are described in Chapter 3.

### Higher Experience Levels

At *Name* (9th) level or greater, a magic-user is called a wizard (if male) or maga (female). Also at *Name* level, a magic-user may create magical items.

Upon reaching *Name* level, a magic-user may build a tower (if he can afford to). A magic-user who constructs a tower will usually attract 1d6 (1-6) apprentices, all magic-users of experience levels 1-3. The DM will decide how many apprentices arrive to serve the wizard, and should create names, backgrounds, and character sheets for them; they should be complete characters.

If a *Name* level magic-user decides to build a tower, or to take up regular residence in the home of a ruler who wishes to employ him, he is referred to as a land-owning magic-user; otherwise, he is a traveling magic-user (even if he actually spends more time in his own home than on the road).

#### Land-Owns Magic-Users: Independent Wizards

Magic-users who decide to live in their own strongholds, regardless of their political affiliations or interest in the outer world, are referred to as independent wizards. They are commonly referred to and addressed as *wizard* or *maga*, whatever their actual titles may be.

An independent magic-user may build or seize a tower. By tradition, he need not seek permission from the local ruler beforehand. If, however, the wizard does seek the ruler's permission, the ruler will probably give the magic-user a lav-

ish gift, official title to the dominion, and possibly some sort of official rank of nobility to keep the favor of the character. (Only the most powerful of rulers would dare to offend a magic-user, whatever their alignment differences.)

After the magic-user moves into his tower, he may choose to build a dungeon beneath or near it. Most wizards and magas employ specialists to do their mining and engineering, but may decide to create the dungeons themselves if they know the proper spells.

Of course, any character building a stronghold could also build a dungeon, a subterranean complex where prisoners can be kept and the character can perform specific researches in secret. But a wizard can choose for *his* dungeon to be different. If, once one or more levels of the dungeon are completed, the wizard leaves an unguarded opening into the dungeon, monsters will be attracted and will build lairs. Some wizards encourage this sort of thing so that they have ready access to a variety of different monster types (useful for research, and for staying aware of what's happening in the realms of monsters).

Such monster-infested dungeons are not looked upon favorably by humans in the region. Dungeons tend to make the locals nervous, and the monsters in them often prey on nearby human communities. Wizards who create these dungeons need to be aware that low level adventurers may take action against the monsters of these dungeons, either to keep the region safe or simply to fill their own coffers with the monsters' treasure.

Independent wizards do not usually live in com-

plete solitude. They may or may not interact with the rulers and nobles of the nations in which they live, as they please. They may continue to go on quests and adventures with their old friends. Other wizards may visit and correspond with them in order to facilitate magical research and understanding. They might participate in the operation of schools of magic. Only the most misanthropic of wizards, or those with much to hide, build their towers in the most dangerous and inaccessible areas and live there alone.

#### Land-Owns Magic-Users: Magists

If a land-owning magic-user cannot or does not want to maintain a tower, the character may apply for a position as a *magist* in any existing castle or stronghold. If the ruler does not have a magist and can afford one, he will usually accept the application... unless the wizard has so vile a reputation that the ruler cannot trust the wizard. The magist advises the ruler in matters involving magic and handles the magical needs of the ruler and the stronghold.

To become a magist, the magic-user must first find a ruler who is willing to hire and support him. He must negotiate payment and other benefits with the ruler. (Standard payment is a minimum of 3,000 gold pieces per month, with magists above 15th level commanding higher payment.) Finally, the character *must* swear an oath of fealty to that ruler to become a magist.

When the agreements and terms are complete, the ruler supplies all the magist's needs, including a place to stay in the stronghold (usually a suite of several rooms), guards and servants, and other agreed-upon benefits (such as magical items, either to use or as outright gifts). The ruler usually pays for magical research costs if the item or spell researched will benefit the stronghold. The magist must serve the ruler as ordered in all respects, but is never required to fight or otherwise be placed in danger.

A magist may go on normal adventures if the ruler gives permission. The ruler knows that more experience means a more powerful magist, and will usually give permission if no immediate magical needs are pressing.

The magist is bound by oath not to work against the interests of his ruler. If at some time in the future he finds that he cannot serve the ruler, he must officially renounce his oath of fealty and depart the ruler's home. He cannot oppose his former ruler until he has left the ruler's home. (If he intends to become an enemy of the ruler, it's best for him to depart in secret and send his official notification by proxy.)

#### Traveling Magic-Users: Magi

A traveling magic-user of either gender is known as a *magus*.

1. A magus may visit any land-owning magic-user to offer to help with magical research. If the offer is accepted, items or spells researched will be completed faster and more efficiently, as described in Chapter 3.
2. The magus will attract powerful traveling fighters and clerics, who offer to travel with and help the magus in return for pay. The magus attracts 1d6 such hirelings. These hirelings are of levels much higher than normal (5th level minimum).

## Chapter 2: The Character Classes

### High Experience Levels and Spell Damage

Here's one final but very important note about high level magic-users:

*Any damage-causing spell can produce a maximum of 20 dice of damage (of whatever type is applicable).* Therefore, a 16th level magic-user casting a *fireball* spell can deal out 16d6 points of damage, but a 27th level caster only inflicts the maximum of 20d6 points of damage.

### Thief

#### Prime Requisite: Dexterity.

Experience Bonus: 5% for Dexterity 13-15, 10% for Dexterity 16-18.

Hit Dice: 1d4 per level up to 9th level. Starting with 10th level, +2 hit points per level, and Constitution adjustments no longer apply.

#### Maximum Level: 36.

Armor: Leather armor only; shield not permitted.

Weapons: Any missile weapon; any one-handed melee weapon.

Special Abilities: At 1st level—Open Locks, Find Traps, Remove Traps, Climb Walls, Move Silently, Hide in Shadows, Pick Pockets, Hear Noise, and Backstab; at 4th level—Read any normal language 80%; at 10th level—cast magic-user spells from scrolls (10% chance of backfire). For the chances of success for these abilities, see "Special Abilities" below.

A thief is a human who specializes in stealth, lockpicking, trap removing, and other such activities. As the name indicates, however, most characters belonging to the thief class do steal. (They rarely steal from their friends or members of their own groups, however. A thief who steals from friends is usually not permitted to adventure with them ever again!)

Thieves belong to an organization (sometimes called a Guild). Every town has a building, called the Guild Hall, where thieves may live and eat (for a price, of course). Every thief learns "the Arts" (a thief's unique skills; see "Special Abilities," below) from teachers at the Guild. Thieves are a normal part of life in most campaign worlds because of their unique and useful skills, but they are not usually welcome in the better pans of towns.

The thief's job is to use his special abilities where needed. A thief's skills can be very useful, and they can be used over and over. For example, a magic-user may use a spell to open a lock, but the spell only works once; a thief may try to open locks whenever desired. Consequently, thieves are found in most groups of adventurers.

Most thieves have high Dexterity scores. Since this can improve their ability to use missile weapons, most thieves use one or more types of missiles. The thief will also find it useful to have a sword or dagger in situations where he can't avoid close combat.

Thieves may advance to 36th level.

### Class Details

Prime Requisite: A thief's prime requisite is Dexterity. If a thief has a Dexterity score of 13-

15, he gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned in every adventure; if his Dexterity is 16-18, the bonus is 10%.

Hit Dice: Roll a 4-sided die (1d4) to determine a thief's hit points. A thief starts with 1d4 (1-4) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d4 more hit points (plus bonus) with each level of experience. Two additional hit points are gained for each level after 9th level.

Armor: A thief may only wear leather armor, and may not use a shield.

Weapons: A thief may use any missile weapon, and any other weapon usable with one hand (two-handed weapons are prohibited).

Thieves have numerous special abilities. They receive some of them at 1st experience level, when they begin play, and receive others as they gain experience levels.

At 1st experience level, thieves know the following skills: Open Locks, Find and Remove Traps, Climb Walls, Move Silently, Hide in Shadows, Pick Pockets, and Hear Noise. They also learn the skill of Backstabbing. The Thief Special Abilities Table shows the development of many of the thief's special abilities.

The column on the left is the thief's experience level; cross-reference his level with the skill he is trying to use. For instance, a 6th level thief using his Climb Walls skill has a 92% chance.

Each number on the table above is the percentage chance that the thief is successful in using that special ability. Tell the Dungeon Master

whenever you want your thief to use a special ability; at the DM's discretion, either the player or the DM will roll percentile dice (d%). If the result is equal to or less than the percentage given, the thief's attempt is successful.

#### Descriptions of the Special Abilities

Open Locks (OL): With successful use of this special ability, and with professional lockpicks (often called "thieves' tools"), the thief may open locks. The character may try to use this skill only once per lock. The thief may not try again with that particular lock until he gains another level of experience. Without lockpicks, he may not use this ability.

Find Traps (FT): With successful use of this special ability, the thief may examine a room or an object and determine whether it is rigged with traps. He may check only once per trap, and failure prevents the character from finding any trap in or on the object searched. (Since the DM actually does the rolling, the player doesn't know how many traps he's rolling to find.) If the thief finds a trap, he may use his Remove Traps ability to remove or deactivate it.

Remove Traps (RT): With successful use of this special ability, the thief may remove or deactivate a trap. He may not roll this ability against a trap unless the trap has been found. The thief may try his ability only once per trap; failure to remove a trap triggers the trap.

Climb Walls (CW): With successful use of this special ability, the thief can climb steep surfaces, such as sheer cliffs, walls, and so forth. The chances for success are good, but if failed, the

\* Thief gains 80% chance to read any normal (nonmagical) writing, language, code, or map

thief slips at the halfway point and falls. The DM rolls for success once for every 100 climbed. If the roll is a failure, the thief takes 1-6 (1d6) points of damage per 10' fallen. Falling during a 10' climb will inflict 1 point of damage.

Move Silently (MS): Successful use of this special ability allows the thief to move silently. When the thief tries to use this skill, he always believes he has been successful, but a failed roll means that someone can hear his passage. The DM, at his discretion, may modify the thief's roll at any time: When he tries moving silently across a field of dried leaves, his percentage chance would go down, while if he does so during a loud tournament, his chance will be greatly enhanced. Note that it doesn't do the thief any good to use this skill against someone who is already aware of him.

Hide in Shadows (HS): Successful use of this special ability means that the thief moves into and remains in shadows, making him very hard to see. While the thief is in shadows, observers only get a chance to see him if they look directly at him, at which time he must roll again; success means that he remains unobserved. While in

shadows, the thief may use his Move Silently ability, but attacking someone reveals the thief. If the thief tries to hide in shadows but fails, he will not know that his position of concealment is a failure until someone sees him and announces the fact. Note that if the thief is under direct observation, he can't hide in shadows against the people watching him; they'll be able to follow his progress with no problem.

Pick Pockets (PP): This special ability allows the character to steal things from another character's person without him noticing. It's a very risky skill to use. If the attempt succeeds, the thief is able to pick the other's pockets without anyone noticing. If the roll is a simple failure, the thief fails to get his hands on what he's seeking. If the roll is greater than twice what the thief needs to succeed or an 00 in any case, the thief is caught in the act by his intended victim, and possibly others.

When using the skill, subtract 5% per level or HD of victim. (Normal men—men and women who have no adventuring ability at all and do not belong to any adventuring character class—are treated as being 0 level.)

**Example:** A 1st level thief tries to pick the pocket of a 1st level fighter walking along the street. His chance is 20% (normal) minus 5 (5 times 1), or 15%. The DM rolls the percentile dice and rolls a 41. This is over twice what he needed to roll, so the thief is caught in the act.

**Hear Noise (HN):** This special ability gives the thief the ability to hear faint noises—such as breathing on the other side of the door, or the clatter of distant footsteps approaching fast. The DM can rule that any loud situation, such as a battle, prevents the thief from using this skill.

### Proper Use of Thief Abilities

Watch for opportunities to use special abilities, and simply tell your Dungeon Master when you want your thief to use one.

A stuck or exceptionally difficult lock, carefully hidden trap, slippery wall, or very faint noise may cause a penalty to be applied to the normal chances of successful skill use. The DM could assign the task a penalty of -5%, -10%, -20%, or higher depending on the difficulty of the task. If, after applying such penalties, the chance of success remains 100% or greater, the DM should adjust it to 99%, allowing a 1% minimum chance of failure in all cases.

However, the DM should not modify Move Silently or Hide in Shadows skill chances unless the thief is undertaking actions that are outside the ability's usual functions (trying to move silently while running at full speed or across a floor covered with peanut shells, hiding when very near to torchlight, etc.).

### Other Thief Abilities

Backstabbing: If a thief can sneak up on a victim, completely unnoticed, the thief may backstab—if he is using a one-handed melee weapon, he may strike at particularly vulnerable points of his target's body. (Though the ability is called "backstabbing," the weapon doesn't have to be a stabbing weapon. A thief can use this ability with a club, for example.)

When backstabbing, the thief gains a bonus of +4 on the attack roll; if the target is hit, the damage done is *twice* normal (roll the damage for the weapon, multiply the result by two, and then add any pertinent modifiers).

If the intended victim sees, hears, or is warned of the thief's approach, the thief's attack is *not* a backstab; it is an ordinary attack, doing the damage appropriate for the weapon used.

When no battle is in progress, a backstab attempt may require a Move Silently ability check. The DM will make all the necessary decisions on that matter.

Read Languages: When the thief reaches 4th level, he gains an 80% chance to read any normal writing or language (including simple codes, dead languages, treasure maps, and so on, but not magical writings). If he tries but fails to read a piece of writing, he must gain at least one experience level before trying to read it again.

Cast Spells From Magic-User Scrolls: At 10th level, a thief gains the ability to cast magic-user spells from spell scrolls. However, there is always a 10% chance that the spell will backfire, creating an unexpected result, because of the thief's imperfect understanding of magical writings. This ability only allows thieves to cast spells from existing magic scrolls, not to write their own.

## Higher Experience Levels

When a thief reaches Name (9th) level, he is called a master thief (whether male or female).

### Land-Owning Thieves

Name level thieves may construct a hideout (a fortified house in a city, a cave network, etc.). A thief who has constructed a hideout will attract 2d6 1st level apprentice thieves, who come to learn from a master. These will generally (though not always) be loyal to the thief, but

will not automatically be replaced by others if they die or leave; the character will have to recruit new thieves himself.

At this point, a player character thief may want to consider setting up a Thieves' Guild.

A thief who wishes to settle must contact the Thieves' Guild of the region where he wants to settle. If the thief has not been an enemy of this Guild (or, even if he has, if he can persuade or bribe the Guild to cooperate), the Guild will help establish the thief as a guildmaster. He may be the master of a new branch of the Guild, an expansion branch in a new neighborhood, or of an established Guild whose leader has stepped down or died.

The Dungeon Master will describe how many new thieves arrive at the new Guild, or will describe how the existing Guild is currently organized. The Guild will generate income from its illegal activities.

The character can, at some point, ask for control of a larger branch of the Guild (this is recommended when 18th level is reached), and may eventually become a powerful official in the Guild Headquarters.

Skilled (high level) thieves are always needed for difficult and unique adventures, and the Guildmaster thief is the person adventurers contact when such jobs are available. You, as the Guildmaster, may choose to take the jobs or allow one or more of the Guild members to have them—but you have first choice, in any case.

### Traveling Thieves

A Name level thief who chooses not to establish any hideout or any station in the local Guild authority is a traveling thief, known also as a rogue.

1. A rogue must remain a member of a Thieves' Guild, though he need visit the Guild only once a year.
2. Once a character becomes a rogue, the character can never become a Guildmaster in an established branch of the Guild. However, if he later decides to settle down, and if the Guildmaster permits, he may set up a new branch of the Guild where none currently exists.
3. A rogue has a chance (checked by the DM once per game week) of discovering treasure maps or rumors about the location of great treasures. This chance is based on him keeping his ear to the thieves' grapevine.
4. Likewise, the rogue may visit any branch of the Thieves' Guild to see the Guildmaster and learn local information, tips, and rumors—if the local Guildmaster is willing to suffer his presence in the territory. If the Guildmaster is willing, it will only be under the condition that the character hire assistance from several low level thieves on a temporary basis.

## Dwarf

Prime Requisite: Strength. Other Requirements: Constitution 9 or better.

Experience Bonus: 5% for Strength 13-15, 10% for Strength 16-18.

Hit Dice: 1d8 per level up to 9th level. Starting with 10th level, +3 hp per level and Constitution adjustments no longer apply.

Maximum Level: 12.

Armor: Any; shields permitted.

Weapons: Any Small or Medium melee weapon; short bows and crossbows permitted, but longbows forbidden.

Special Abilities: Fighter Maneuvers (Lance Attack and Set Spear vs. Charge maneuvers at 1st level; at 660,000 XP, Fighter Combat Options); half damage from spells at 1,400,000 XP; inviravision; extra languages (dwarf, gnome, goblin, kobold); 1 in 3 chance to detect traps, sliding walls, sloping corridors, new construction.

A dwarf is short and stocky, standing about 4' tall and weighing about 150 pounds. Male dwarves wear long beards. Their skin is ruddy or earth-colored and their hair is dark brown, gray, or black. Stubborn but practical, dwarves are fond of good food and drink. They value craftsmanship and love gold. Dwarves are sturdy fighters and are resistant to magic.

Although the dwarf class is different from the fighter class in many ways, their tasks are the same. Dwarves are only able to attain a maximum of 12 experience levels at best. However, this is balanced by the dwarves special abilities, such as the ability to see in the dark, detection abilities, and better saving throws. Dwarves are formidable fighters, no matter what their level.

Dwarven families are organized in Clans.

## Class Details

Prime Requisite: A dwarfs prime requisite is Strength. If a dwarf has a Strength score of 13-15, the character gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned in every adventure; if his Strength is 16-18, the bonus is 10%.

Minimum Scores: A dwarf character must have a Constitution score of 9 or greater when first played.

Hit Dice: Roll an 8-sided die (1d8) to determine a dwarfs hit points. A dwarf starts with 1d8 (1-8) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d8 more hit points (plus bonus) with each experience level. Three hit points are gained per level after 9th level.

Armor: A dwarf may wear any kind of armor, and may use a shield.

Weapons: A dwarf may use any small or medium melee weapon. (If you're unsure as to whether a weapon is small or medium, see the Weapons Table in Chapter 4.) They may not use longbows, but can use short bows and crossbows.

## Special Abilities

### Special Attacks

Dwarves are good fighters. Like fighters, they know the Lance Attack and Set Spear vs. Charge maneuvers.

### Fighter Combat Options

When the dwarves experience points total reaches 660,000, he gains the Fighter Combat Options (see "Combat Maneuvers" in Chapter 8).

With the multiple attacks combat option, the dwarf can make two attacks at 660,000 experience points, and three at 2,200,000 experience

points. He can use the smash and parry combat options, but cannot use the disarm option against a giant-sized opponent. (A giant-sized opponent is any monster which is described as being a giant, a giant animal, a gargantua, or is otherwise in the DM's opinion enormous.)

### Special Defenses

Experienced dwarves become more resistant to magic. When the dwarf reaches the 1,400,000 experience point mark, the dwarf automatically takes only half damage from any damage-causing spell or spell-like effect (such as from a magical item or strange monster powers such as beholders' eyes but not including dragon's breath). Divide the rolled damage by 2 and round down. If the effect allows a saving throw, a successful roll indicates that he only takes 1/4 damage; divide the rolled damage by 4 and round down. (If the result is 1/2 point of damage or less, the character takes 1 point of damage.)

### Infravision

Infravision is the ability to see heat (and the lack of heat). Dwarves have infravision in addition to normal sight and can see 60° in the dark. Infravision does not work in the presence of normal and magical light. With infravision, warm things appear red, and cold things appear blue. A creature could be seen as a red shape, leaving faint reddish footprints. A cold pool of water would seem a deep blue color.

Characters with infravision can even see items or creatures the same temperature as the surrounding air (such as a table or a skeleton), since air flow will inevitably show the viewer their borders, outlining them in a faint lighter-blue tone. Until they move, they will be very faint to the

eye; once they start moving, they become blurry but very obvious light-blue figures.

Infravision isn't good enough to read by. A character can use his infravision to recognize an individual only if they are within 10° distance... unless the individual is very, very distinctive (for example, 8' tall or walking with a crutch).

### Languages

In addition to Common and alignment tongues, a dwarf can speak the languages of the dwarf, gnome, goblin, and kobold races.

### Detection

Dwarves can sometimes detect traps (specifically, traps built into stone-work or heavy construction, not other types of traps such as rope-traps in the forest or spring-out needles built into a jewelry box); they can also detect sliding walls, sloping corridors, and new constructions.

If your dwarf character wants to search for such

things in an area, tell the DM. You have 1 chance in 3 to find them. The DM will roll 1d6, and a 1 or 2 will indicate success if there is anything to find; a result of 3-6 means your dwarf detects nothing. You may check once for each trap, sliding wall, sloping corridor, or new construction. You must tell the DM if you want to look for anything; the detection is never automatic.

### Higher Experience Levels

When a dwarf reaches Name (9th) level, he is usually referred to as a dwarf lord (or dwarf lady, in the case of female dwarves).

He may build a stronghold. Unless he has forsaken his dwarf clan and is living among humans, it should be an underground cavern complex located in either mountains or hills. (If he is living among humans, he may build any sturdy stone dwelling in the human fashion instead, but will still want for there to be an underground complex connected to it.) The

## Chapter 2: The Character Classes

character may hire only dwarven mercenaries, but may hire specialists and hirelings of other races.

### Elf

**Prime Requisites:** Strength and Intelligence. Other Requirements: Intelligence score of 9 or more.

**Experience Bonus:** 5% for Strength of 13 or better and Intelligence of 13-15, 10% for Strength of 13 or better and Intelligence of 16-18.

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per level up to 9th level. 10th level, +1 hit point, and Constitution adjustment does not apply.

**Maximum Level:** 10.

**Armor:** All; shields permitted.

**Weapons:** Any.

**Special Abilities:** Fighter Maneuvers (Lance Attack, Set Spear vs. Charge; at 850,000 XP, Combat Options for Fighters); half damage from dragon breath at 1,600,000 XP; infravision; extra languages (elf, gnoll, hobgoblin, orc); 1 in 3 chance to detect secret and hidden doors; immunity to ghoul paralysis; magic spells.

An elf is slender and graceful, with delicate features and pointed ears. An elf is 5' to 5 1/2' tall, and weighs about 120 pounds.

Elves are able to use all types of armor and weapons, and can cast magical spells.

Few elves are adventurers; most prefer to spend their time feasting and frolicking in woodland glades. Except for adventurers, elves rarely visit the cities of man.

Elves are fascinated by magic and never grow tired of collecting spells and magical items, especially if the items are beautifully crafted.

Elves are similar to both fighters and magic-users. Read the description of the fighter class for some tips on playing a fighter-type character, but remember that the elf does not have as many hit points as a fighter. The elf can best perform as a fighter if he is undamaged or only slightly hurt before entering a battle; otherwise, he should stay back and help with magic spells, as a magic-user does.

An elf may only advance to 10th level. However, this is balanced by the elf's special abilities, especially the combination of fighting and spellcasting. This combination makes an elf far more powerful than a human of the same level.

Elves only employ other elves as mercenary fighters, although they may hire specialists and hirelings of any race.

Elven families live in Clans.

### Class Details

**Prime Requisite:** Elves have two prime requisites: Strength and Intelligence. If an elf has a score of 13 or more in both ability scores, he gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned. If his Intelligence score is 16-18 and his Strength is 13 or more, the bonus is 10%.

**Minimum Scores:** An elf character must have Intelligence 9 or greater when first played.

**Hit Dice:** Roll a 6-sided die (1d6) to determine an elf's hit points. An elf starts with 1d6 (1-6) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any)

and gains 1d6 more hit points (plus bonus) with each level of experience. Two additional hit points are gained at 10th level.

**Armor:** An elf may wear any kind of armor, and may use a shield.

**Weapons:** An elf may use any weapon.

### Special Abilities

**Special Attacks**

After reaching maximum level (10th), elves may continue to improve in combat ability. This is a slow process, however, due to the fact that they must divide their training time between fighting and magic. Elves always know the following fighter maneuvers: Set Spear vs. Attack; Lance Attack.

**Fighter Combat Options**

When the character's experience point total reaches 850,000, the character receives the Combat Options for fighters (see their description on page 104, under "Combat Maneuvers"). With multiple attacks, two attacks are possible at 850,000 experience points, and three attacks at 2,600,000 experience points; the elf never gains four attacks per round. The elf may use the smash, parry, and disarm options as described in the text.

**Special Defenses**

Experienced elves become more resistant to dragon breath. When the elf reaches the 1,600,000 experience points mark, he automatically takes only half damage from any breath

weapon (most notably dragon breath, but including all sorts of breath weapon attacks). If the breath allows a saving throw, a successful roll indicates that the elf takes only one-quarter damage. When modifying damage sustained, always round down. If the result is 1/2 point of damage or less, the character takes 1 point of damage.

**Infravision**

Elves have infravision identical to that of dwarves. See the description of infravision in the explanation of the dwarfs' special abilities.

**Languages**

In addition to the languages of all characters—the Common and alignment tongues—an elf can speak the languages of the elf, gnoll, hobgoblin, and ore races.

**Detection**

All elves can find secret and hidden doors better than other characters. "You must tell the DM if you want to look for secret and hidden doors; the detection is never automatic.

**Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis**

All elves are naturally immune to the paralyzing attacks of ghouls. Other types of paralysis, such as attacks from a carrion crawler or gelatinous cube, do affect them normally.

**Spells**

Elves can use magic-user spells just as magic-users can, though they receive fewer and lower level spells. Spell are described in Chapter 3.

![Illustration of an elf character, likely a fighter, wearing leaf-patterned clothing and holding a bow and arrow.]()![](_page_24_Picture_43.jpeg)

## Chapter 2: The Character Classes

### Higher Experience Levels

When the elf reaches *Name* (9th) level, he is often referred to as a lord wizard (if male) or lady maga (if female).

He may build a special kind of stronghold deep in the forest. This stronghold must pleasingly blend with its surroundings, usually a natural site of great beauty. Typical locations are the tops of great trees, on the edges of quiet vales, or behind rushing waterfalls. Because of the effort to beautify the work, the structure costs as much as similar work if made of stone.

When the stronghold is completed, the character will develop a friendship with the animals of the forest (birds, rabbits, squirrels, foxes, bears, etc.). All normal animals within five miles of the stronghold will be friendly toward the elves dwelling there. Animals will be able to warn of approaching strangers, carry news of events, deliver short messages to nearby places, etc. In return for these services, the animals will expect the elves to help and protect them.

### Halfling

Prime Requisite: Strength and Dexterity.  
Other Requirements: Dexterity of 9 or better, Constitution of 9 or better.

Experience Bonus: 5% for either Strength or Dexterity of 13 or more, 10% for both Strength and Dexterity of 13 or more.

Hit Dice: 1d6 per level up to 8th level.  
Maximum Level: 8.

Armor: Any; shield is permitted; armor must be designed specifically for halflings.  
Weapons: Any Small melee weapon; short bow; light crossbow.

Special Abilities: Fighter Maneuver (Set Spear vs. Charge); at 900,000 XP, Fighter Combat Options); Combat Bonuses (-2 AC vs. monsters larger than man-size, +1 to attack roll with missile weapons, +1 to Individual Initiative); half damage from spells at 300,000 XP, half damage from dragon breath at 2,100,000 XP; 90% chance to hide motionless in woodlands, 33% chance to hide motionless in dimly lit building interiors.

A halfling is a short demihuman, and looks much like a human child with slightly pointed ears. A halfling stands about 3' tall and weighs about 60 pounds. Halflings rarely have beards.

Halflings are outgoing but not unusually brave, seeking treasure as a way to gain the comforts of home, which they so dearly love. Halflings prefer to live in pleasant areas of fair countryside near rolling hills and gentle streams. When not working or adventuring, halflings will spend most of their time eating, drinking, talking with friends, and relaxing. Their communities are called shires, and their recognized spokesman is called a Sheriff. Halfling families live in Clans.

Halflings are woodland folk, and usually get along well with elves and dwarves. They have special abilities in the outdoors. Halflings behave similarly to fighters and dwarves. A halfling's saving throws are as good as those of dwarves. Halflings may only advance to 8th level. This limitation is balanced by their

woodland abilities, saving throws, and combat bonuses.

### Class Details

Prime Requisite: A halfling has two prime requisites: Strength and Dexterity. If either of these ability scores is 13 or greater, the character gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned in every adventure. If both of these scores are 13 or greater, the experience points bonus is 10%.

Minimum Scores: A halfling character must have a score of 9 or greater in both Dexterity and Constitution.

Hit Dice: Roll a 6-sided die (1d6) to determine a halfling's hit points. A halfling starts with 1d6 (1-6) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d6 more hit points (plus bonus) with each level of experience.

Armor: A halfling may wear any kind of armor, and may use a shield. However, their armor and shields must be specially made for their small size. Even dwarf-sized armor is too large for them.

Weapons: A halfling may use any Small melee weapon and may use short bows and light crossbows. (If you're unsure whether a weapon is Small or not, see the Weapons Table found in Chapter 4.)

### Special Abilities

#### Combat Bonuses

All halflings gain the following bonuses when in combat.

#### Halfling Combat Bonuses Table

| -2 | bonus to armor class when attacked by creatures larger than man-sized (i.e., an AC of 6 becomes a 4) |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| +1 | bonus to the attack roll when using any missile weapon                                               |
| +1 | bonus to individual initiative (see Chapter 8 for details on Initiative)                             |

A creature is larger than man-sized when it is referred to as "giant," "gargantuan," or "enormous" in a monster description. It is likewise larger than man-sized if it is a real-world creature which the DM considers bigger than a man (for example, a horse). As a rule of thumb, any non-human-shaped creature whose size is not otherwise given in a description can be presumed to be larger than man-sized if it has 4 or more HD.

#### Special Attacks

In combat, a halfling may use the Set Spear vs. Charge maneuver, as described in Chapter 8 under "Combat Maneuvers." They are too small to utilize the Lance Attack maneuver, however.

### Fighter Combat Options

When the halfling's experience point total reaches 900,000, he gains the Fighter Combat Options on page 104. For the multiple attacks option, two attacks are possible at 900,000 experience points, and three attacks at 3,000,000 experience points. The halfling can use the smash and parry options as described, but cannot use the disarm option effectively against a giant-sized opponent.

### Special Defenses

Experienced halflings become more resistant to both magic and breath weapons. When the halfling reaches the 300,000 experience point mark, he automatically takes only half damage from any damage-causing spell or spell-like effect (such as from a magical item). If the effect allows a saving throw, a successful roll indicates that he takes only 1/4 damage.

In addition, when the halfling reaches the 2,100,000 experience point mark, he likewise automatically takes only half damage from breath weapons (most notably dragon breath, but including all sorts of breath weapon attacks), and takes only 1/4 damage if he successfully makes a saving throw (if the attack allows one).

When modifying sustained damage, always round fractions down. If the result is 1/2 point of damage or less, the character takes 1 point of damage.

### Woodland Abilities

Outdoors, halflings are difficult to spot, having the ability to hide in woods or underbrush. In such cover, they have a 90% chance to remain unseen (the DM will roll). Halflings can even

### Halfling Saving Throws Table

| Levels                  | 1-3 | 4-6 | 7-8 |
|-------------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Death Ray/Poison        | 8   | 5   | 2   |
| Magic Wands             | 9   | 6   | 3   |

| Breath Attack*          | 13  | 9   | 5   |
| Rod/Staff/Spell**       | 12  | 8   | 4   |

\* At 2,100,000 XP, halflings take half damage from breath weapons, or one-quarter damage if the saving throw is successful.

\*\* At 300,000 XP, halflings take half damage from spells, or one-quarter damage if the saving throw is successful.

hide in building interiors such as dungeons, though not with as much success. In such situations, if a halfling finds some deep shadows or cover to hide in, his chance drops to 33%; if he cannot find shadows or cover, he has no chance at all.

This ability is not the same as the thief's Move Silently or Hide in Shadows abilities. To use his ability, the halfling must stay motionless. If he tries to move to another site, anyone can see him.

When your halfling uses this ability, inform the DM. He'll roll percentile dice (d%) for the halfling. On a roll of 90 or less, the halfling will remain unnoticed. On a 91 or greater, observers with a chance to detect the halfling will do so. In a dungeon or other building interior, the DM will roll d%. On a roll of 33 or less, the halfling remains undetected; on a 34 or greater, an ob-

server who has a chance to detect him will do so.

Indoors, a light bright enough to banish shadows and illuminate everything well (such as magical light) will ruin the hiding attempt. Naturally, if the halfling character is himself carrying a light, it will be impossible for him to hide.

### Higher Experience Levels

A halfling reaching 8th experience level is usually referred to by the title of sheriff. In your campaign, this may be a merely honorary title, or the DM may choose to have the halfling character be elected to a local sheriff's position.

Regardless of his experience level, a halfling may build a stronghold whenever he has the money and the interest. The stronghold will attract a whole community of other halflings if constructed in a place suited to their preferences.

![Illustration of a druid, a cloaked figure holding a staff topped with a dragon head.]()![](_page_27_Picture_3.jpeg)

### Druid (Optional)

**Prime Requisite:** Wisdom. Other Requirements: Neutral alignment.

**Experience Bonus:** 5% for Wisdom 13-15, 10% for Wisdom 16-18.

**Hit Dice:** Starting with 10th level, +1 hit point per level, and Constitution adjustments do not apply.

**Maximum Level:** 36; Druid must challenge and defeat another Druid of the newly attained experience level starting at 30th level.

**Armor:** Leather armor; shield permitted if made only of wood and leather.

**Weapons:** Any non-edged/non-piercing weapon made with no metal.

**Special Abilities:** Spells (both druidic and clerical).

A Neutral cleric of 9th to 29th level may choose to study nature instead of remaining among "civilized" areas. If he does so, he changes character class and becomes a druid. To become a druid, the cleric must find and live in a woodland home, meditating for one to four (1d4, rolled by the DM) months.

During that time, a higher level druid (usually 25th level or greater) will find the cleric, test him for worthiness, and teach him the principles of druidic philosophy and magic. (The DM may prefer to handle all that in the background, or to make a protracted role-playing adventure out of it.) The new druid

may then join the realm of the druids.

A druid is pure Neutral, never Lawful or Chaotic. The druid devotes his life to the balance of all things and to the study of nature.

Druid items and equipment are all made of items that were once alive (leather, wood, etc.). "Dead" things that have never been alive are repulsive to the druid; the character simply won't *want to use or touch them*. However, the character should not object if others use "dead" things. Thus, a druid can be a challenging character to play, but the role can be entertaining.

Druids, unlike clerics, have no power to turn undead and so have reason to fear undead monsters. They may contact town churches if undead monsters threaten their realms.

Every druid lives in, protects, and tends a section of woodlands. (Druids must live in a natural setting; they cannot live in a city or town.) Druids do not think of themselves as owners, but rather as caretakers, of wilderness. Nearly every tree in every woodland is cared for by a druid. Although minor damage to the woods is a fact of life, druids punish deliberate evil destruction of trees or nature. Even Chaotic monsters know this, and avoid harming things of the woods lest they incur the wrath of the local druid.

The DM and players should be sure not to abuse this protective role. For example, a party foraging for food would not be attacked by a druid unless they killed more animals than they could eat, wantonly destroyed trees, etc.

The battles of Law and Chaos are not the affairs of the druids, and they may simply watch such encounters from afar, helping neither side.

When characters perform good deeds in the woodlands, such as curing wounded animals, this does not make the druid automatically friendly. However, assistance in fighting a huge disaster—such as a magical storm or major forest fire—could earn the gratitude and possible friendship of a druid.

Should the druid change alignment, he will retain all the clerical abilities and clerical spells which druids can use (but will not regain his ability to turn undead); he will lose all druid benefits including druidic spells unless he returns to Neutral alignment.

Druids have unusual abilities that help them in their woodland role, but they also have many restrictions. These are described below.

### Class Details

**Prime Requisite:** A druid's prime requisite is Wisdom. If a druid has a Wisdom score of 13-15 the character gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned; if his Wisdom is 16-18, he earns a 10% bonus to experience points.

**Hit Dice:** A character cannot become a druid until he has reached at least Name (9th) experience level as a cleric. Therefore, from then on, he will receive only 1 hit point per experience level gained after 9th level.

**Armor:** The druid may not wear metal armor or use metal items. He can wear leather armor and shields made of wood and leather.

**Weapons:** Druids, like clerics, may not use piercing or cutting weapons; and even of the weapon types they can use, they may not have weapons with metal parts. He can commission craftsmen to make all-wooden versions of appropriate weapons; they cost 50% more than their counterparts, but otherwise behave identically.

### Abilities and Restrictions

#### Druid Spells

Druids can cast any spells that clerics can (except those which affect good or evil, as described below). Druids also have access to a special list of druid spells, which normal clerics cannot learn or cast. The druid is not able to cast *more* spells per day than a cleric, but he can use spells from both cleric and druidic spell lists. The principles of clerical and druidic magic and the lists of spells are found in Chapter 3.

A druid cannot cast any spell that affects good or evil (*protection from evil* or *dispel evil*, for example). He must live in a woodland home, rather than in a town or city. He may visit a city (though he won't feel comfortable there), and he will always prefer to sleep in the wilderness—in a cave or other natural shelter if the weather is bad.

### Higher Experience Levels

Druids at Name (9th) level or above receive the title of druid, whether male or female. There are only nine druids of 30th level, seven of 31st, five of 32nd, four of 33rd, three of 34th, two of 35th, and one of 36th (the Great Druid).

When the character reaches 30th level, he must find and challenge one of the nine 30th level druids; they will only fight with magic and

unarmed combat, as weapons are not allowed. If the player character loses, he stays at 29th level, losing enough experience points that he is 1 experience point short of 30th level. Once he's regained 30th level, he may try again, but cannot issue another challenge until three months have passed since his first challenge.

### Mystic (Optional)

Prime Requisite: Strength and Dexterity.  
Other Requirements: Wisdom and Dexterity scores of 13 or better.

Experience Bonus: 5% for Strength 13-15, 10% for Strength 16-18.

Hit Dice: 1d6 per level up to 9th level.  
Starting with 10th level, +2 hit points per level, and Constitution adjustments no longer apply.

#### Maximum Level: 16.

Armor: None; shield not permitted.

#### Weapons: Any.

Special Abilities: AC bonuses, increased movement, and martial arts (see Mystic Special Abilities Table); (at 9th level) Set Spear vs. Charge, Fighter Combat Options; Acrobatics; thief abilities; mystic abilities.

Mystics are monastic humans who follow a strict discipline of meditation, denial, seclusion, and mastery of the human body. Mystics are skilled in unarmed combat. They live in cloisters, or monastic communities.

Mystics adventure to gain spiritual growth and learn the lessons of life outside the cloister. They rarely adventure with other mystics; they prefer to attach themselves to adventuring parties consisting of many different types of adventurers.

Mystics receive experience from treasure only if they donate it to the needy. Also, they must donate (tithe) ten percent of their treasure to their cloister.

A mystic's oath is his bond. He must be true to his oath and strive to repay all debts. Should he forswear himself (break an oath he has made), he is expelled from the cloister, may not gain any new experience levels, loses one level per year away from the cloister, and may not join any other, similar, cloister. The DM may allow him a grand quest to regain his honor and his standing in the cloister.

Most mystics (75%) are Lawful, though other alignments are represented. All are utterly devoted to the mystic discipline, which is neither good nor evil, similar in that respect to Druid philosophy. However, the mystics rely on inner-

strength, and believe in extraordinary but non-magical powers (rather than the powers of nature, as the druids do).

Mystics can often be recognized by their robes or other unusual garb, but another distinctive feature is their salute. Upon meeting another creature presumed to be peaceful, the mystic raises a fist, covers it with the other hand, and bows slightly. This symbolizes greetings (the bow), readiness to fight if necessary (the fist), but peaceful intentions (the covered fist).

### Class Details

Prime Requisite: The mystic has two prime requisites, Strength and Dexterity. But since he must have a score of at least 13 in Dexterity to be a mystic in the first place, it is his Strength score that determines his bonus to experience. If a mystic has a Strength score of 13-15 the character gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned in every adventure; if his Strength is 16-18, he earns a 10% bonus to experience points.

Minimum Scores: A mystic character *must* have scores of 13 or better in both his Wisdom and Dexterity abilities.

Hit Dice: Roll a 6-sided die (1d6) to determine a mystic's hit points. A mystic starts with 1d6 (1-6) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d6 more hit points (plus bonus) with each level of experience. Two hit points are gained for every level beyond 9th level.

Armor: Mystics can never wear armor of any type, nor can they ever use protective magical devices (such as rings, cloaks, etc.); they rely on their discipline for protection.

Weapons: Mystics are trained to use all weapons, but not all mystics carry them; higher level mystics especially travel unarmed, or armed only with a walking-staff which doubles as a quarter-staff.

### Special Abilities

Mystics have a lot of special abilities, which help compensate for their inability to wear armor or own personal possessions; we'll describe them below.

Level: This column shows the mystic's experience level.

AC: This column shows the mystic's armor class. Mystics cannot wear armor, but their ACs

### Mystic Unarmed Attack Equivalents Table

| Level | Weapon     |
|-------|------------|
| 2     | Equivalent |
| 5     | +1 weapon  |
| 8     | +2 weapon  |
| 11    | +3 weapon  |
| 14    | +4 weapon  |
| 16    | +5 weapon  |

These attacks don't gain the attack or damage bonuses of their magic-weapon equivalents, but can hit creatures as if the indicated weapon were used. For example, a 5th level mystic can hit and hurt a gargoyle when fighting baredhanded.

**Set Spear vs. Charge, Fighter Combat Options**  
Beginning mystics can utilize the fighter's Set Spear vs. Charge maneuver. They cannot utilize the Lance Attack maneuver.

**At Name (9th) level**, they get three of the Fighter Combat Options (smash, parry, and disarm, but not multiple attacks). The Fighter Combat Options are detailed under "Combat Maneuvers" in Chapter 8.

### Acrobatics

Some mystics may also possess a special ability called acrobatics. This specialized ability, while useful, detracts a mystic from fully focussing on his combat abilities; this is why acrobatic mystics have a -20% penalty on all earned experience. Acrobatics allows a mystic to perform the following actions:

- Jumps/Leaps
- Tumbles/Flips
- Catches (to prevent oneself from falling)
- Swings
- Balancing

The game effects of this ability are these:

First, the mystic's acrobatics ability includes every feature of the Acrobatics general skill mentioned in Chapter 5.

Second, with a successful ability check, the mystic can cross rough, broken terrain at no modification to his movement rate: He flips over obstructions, leaps across trenches, handsprings over low fences, etc. This doesn't affect his long-distance movement rates; it only affects his encounter speed and running speed.

Third, the mystic can cross a line of enemy warriors without having to go around or break through it. With a successful ability check, he can roll between the legs of one opponent, or handspring over the line, or pole-vault using his spear, and thus cross a distance equal to his encounter speed's movement rate. He suffers no AC penalty when he performs this action.

The mystic's chance to perform any of these actions successfully is calculated this way: Three times the mystic's Dexterity score plus two times the mystic's experience level equals the mystic's percentile chance to perform the action.

### Acrobatics Check =

$$d^{\text{roll}} \text{ vs. } ([3 \times \text{Dex}] + [2 \times \text{Lvl}])$$

For example, a 3rd level mystic with Dexterity 15 would have a 51% chance to perform an Acrobatics feat.

become lower as they gain in experience due to their skill in maneuvering.

**MV:** This column shows the mystic's movement rate. First level mystics move as fast as any other unarmored characters, but higher level mystics learn to move very, very fast indeed.

**Hand Attacks**—#AT: Mystics are very effective fighters; as they go up in levels, they are able to attack multiple times per round, and this column shows how many times per round they may attack. Mystics use this column when attacking either bare-handed or when using melee weapons.

**Bare-Handed**, **Damage**: When mystics fight bare-handed, they use this column to find the amount of damage they do. They do add Strength bonuses to the amount of damage shown.

### Martial Arts

Mystics are able to fight very effectively without using weapons or magic. They utilize a form of unarmed combat as part of their mystical training. They call this training "the discipline," but others often call it "martial arts." The disci-

pline involves physical training, meditation, philosophy, and comprehension of the forces of the universe, and mystics are taught to resolve difficult situations peacefully whenever possible; for these reasons, mystics do not care to have their lifestyles referred to as "martial arts," as the term suggests that all they do is fight. The mystics' discipline is presumed to integrate and vastly improve upon the bare-handed combat techniques described in Chapter 8.

As you can see in the Mystic Special Abilities Table on the next page, mystics can strike more often than normal humans, elude attacks better (their enhanced AC), and deal more damage when fighting baredhanded. They can also fight with weapons, and can use their multiple attacks per round with melee and throw weapons (but not missile weapons).

In addition, when fighting unarmed, they can often hurt monsters which can ordinarily only be hit by magical weapons. Though a mystic's hands are not magical, an experienced mystic can use them effectively against creatures immune to normal weapons, as shown in the Mystic Unarmed Attack Equivalents Table.

## Chapter 2: The Character Classes

The DM, if he prefers to make acrobatics an easier and more commonly useful ability, can decide to use some alternate means to check success. For example, he might have the player roll 1d20 against his Dexterity score, with any roll equal to or less than the Dexterity score indicating success.

Whatever type of roll he uses, the DM is free to adjust any individual roll to reflect the difficulty of the action being attempted. Doing a backflip on the street to entertain a flock of children is much easier than doing one while walking on a wire ten stories in the air; the DM might wish to improve the mystic's chance to perform the former task and make the latter task harder.

### Thief Abilities

Any mystic can use the following special abilities of thieves as if he were a thief of the same level: Find Traps, Remove Traps, Move Silently, Climb Walls, and Hide in Shadows.

### Mystic Abilities

Mystics gain the following special abilities as they progress in experience levels:

2nd Level: Awareness

4th Level: Heal Self

6th Level: Speak with Animals

8th Level: Resistance

10th Level: Speak with Anyone

12th Level: Mind Block

14th Level: Blankout

16th Level: Gentle Touch

### Explanations of Mystic Abilities

**Awareness:** The mystic is only surprised on a roll of 1 (on 1d6). (Surprise is explained in Chapter 7.)

**Heal Self:** The mystic may, once per day, cure himself of 1 point of damage for each experience level he has. He does this simply by concentrating for 1 round. Example: a 10th level mystic can concentrate for one round and will heal (regain 10 hit points of damage).

**Speak with Animals:** The mystic may speak with any normal or giant animal as often as desired; animals understand his speech and he understands theirs, though no animal is forced to talk to him.

**Resistance:** The mystic takes only half damage (round down) from all spells and breath weapons that inflict damage, or one-quarter damage (round down) if the saving throw is successful. Any attack that does him damage will do a minimum of 1 point of damage, even if rounding indicates 0 points of damage.

**Speak with Anyone:** The mystic may speak with any living creature that has a language of any sort, as often as desired. The creature being spoken to does not have to converse with him.

**Mind Block:** The mystic is immune to *ESP*, *hold* and *slow* spells, magical *charms*, *quests*, and *geas* spells.

**Blankout:** By concentrating for 1 round, the mystic causes his presence to "disappear." No living or undead creature can see him; there is no saving throw. The effect lasts for 1 round per level of the mystic; it is dispelled automatically if he attacks. He may only do this once per day.

\* The mystic receives the Fighter Combat Options (not including multiple attacks); see the description of them under "Combat Maneuvers" in Chapter 8. The mystic can use these Combat Options with weapons or in unarmed fighting.

## Higher Experience Levels

A mystic of *Name* (9th) level is addressed as master (if male) or mistress (if female).

There are many mystics of 1st to 9th level, but only seven each of 10th to 12th level, five each of 13th to 15th level, and three of 16th level.

When the character gains enough experience points to reach 10th level, he must find and challenge one of the seven 10th level mystics; they will fight bare-handed (weapons are not allowed). If the player character loses, he stays at 9th level, losing enough experience points that he is 1 experience point short of 10th level. Once he's regained 10th level, he may try again, but cannot issue another challenge until three months have passed since his first challenge. (Note: If a DM's campaign world is particularly large, he might declare that there are seven 10th and so forth *per continent* in his world.)

At Name level, the mystic may desire to build a stronghold, or *cloister*. If his Grand Abbot (i.e., the mystic in charge of his current cloister) agrees that he is fit to manage one, the cloister will pay for construction of the new cloister. The new cloister remains a branch of the old one until the PC achieves 13th level, at which time the PC is called a Greater Master and can declare independence. At that point, he may wish to teach his mystics-in-training in techniques and philosophies different from those of the other cloister—that is, he may wish to establish his own "school" of the discipline.

## Special Restrictions

Mystics may not use protective magical devices (such as rings, cloaks, etc.).

All the material goods (money, magical items, etc.) won, purchased, or acquired as treasure by the mystic are actually owned by his cloister, not by the mystic himself. Should the cloister have need of something "owned" by a mystic, the head of the cloister need only ask for it.

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_31_Picture_2.jpeg)

## Introduction to Spellcasting

In this chapter, we'll learn how characters acquire and then cast magical spells of all types.

You've already seen that some characters are more accomplished and powerful than others, and that the more powerful ones are said to be at higher experience levels than those who are less powerful. Spells are rated in much the same way, in *levels*. Lower-level spellcasters can learn only lower-level spells; higher-level spellcasters can add higher-level spells. Higher-level spells are more powerful than lower-level spells.

In the D&D® game, there are three different categories of spells: clerical, magical, and druidic. Here's a little table which shows you which type of character can use which type of spell.

### Classes and Spells Table

| Character Class       | Can Use Which Type of Spell |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Cleric                | Clerical                    |
| Druid                 | Clerical, Druidic           |
| Elf                   | Magical                     |
| (Fighter Sub-Classes) |                             |
| Avenger               | Clerical                    |
| Paladin               | Clerical                    |
| Magic-user            | Magical                     |
| Shaman                | Clerical, Druidic           |
| Thief                 | Magical*                    |
| Wokan                 | Magical                     |

\* At level 10+, and only from scrolls

The avenger and paladin are fighter subclasses; see the description of the fighter class. Shamans and wokani are spellcaster monsters, as described in Chapter 14.

The fact that character classes use different types of magic keeps all spellcasters from being identical to one another. A cleric will cast a very different type of spell from a magic-user; an elf will cast the same sorts of spells as a magic-user, but far fewer, and he can fight much better than the magic-user; a druid can cast clerical spells, but he really shines when he's casting druidic spells, which are his specialty; and so on.

## Memorizing Spells

During an adventure, a spellcaster can only use spells he has memorized. Memorization is a special process of imprinting one use of a spell in the caster's mind. When the Spellcasting character memorizes a spell, he holds it in his mind and can cast it at any time. But when he casts it, it vanishes from his memory: His knowledge of it flows away as the spell discharges. For this reason, characters constantly have to re-memorize spells.

Magic-users and elves can only use spells that they have found, researched, or have been taught by their mentors. These spells are recorded in a large, bound volume called a "spell book." The book is written in a magical language that only the magic-user who owns the book can read. This spell book is the list of spells that can be used by that character when taking spells for an adventure.

Clerics and druids gain their spells through meditation. Players can choose which spells their

clerics have memorized at the beginning of an adventure. They do not need to write down their spells, since they can simply memorize to re-memorize them.

### Resting and Re-Memorizing

After a spell is cast, the character cannot re-memorize it until he is well-rested. One night's sleep is enough rest. Upon awakening, before he spends time on any strenuous activities, the spellcaster must spend an hour (of game time) in study or meditation. Magic-users and elves must use their spell books to regain spells, while clerics and druids need only meditate.

Just because spellcasters spend their mornings doing their memorization or meditation for spells, it doesn't mean that they forget their uncast spells overnight. Unless they wish to do so, they won't forget the spells they didn't cast. The next morning, the spellcaster needs only to study or meditate to replace those spells he cast the previous day.

### Multiples of the Same Spell

Characters often memorize the same spell multiple times so that they can cast it several times in the course of a day. A cleric knowing that he's going to face fierce battle during the day may memorize numerous cure *light wounds* spells, for instance.

## Number of Spells Known

In the last chapter, you saw experience tables for all the character classes. The experience tables for clerics, magic-users, elves, and druids had a block of columns labelled "Spells/Level." This column shows you *how many spells of each spell level the character can have memorized at one time*.

For instance, take a look at the table below. It is taken from the experience table of the cleric class.

| Cleric Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8            | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | — | — | — |

In this chart, we see that an 8th level cleric can, at any one time, memorize nine spells and no more. He'll know three 1st level spells, three 2nd level spells, two 3rd level spells, and one 4th level spell.

In the course of a day, as he casts them, he forgets them. If he were to cast two 1st level spells and his 4th level spell, he'd only know one 1st level spell, three 2nd level spells, and two 3rd level spells.

The "Spells/Level" columns on the experience charts shows how many spells can be memorized at any one time, not how many spells the spellcaster has access to. He doesn't have to memorize the same spells every day. Magic-users may have more spells in their books than they can know at any one time; clerics may, over a period of days, learn many more different spells than they can cast in a single day.

## Casting Spells

In the game, when you want your character to cast a spell, just tell your Dungeon Master. The

DM may ask for some details; for example, some spells are cast at a target, and you must tell the DM what the target is. For example, a cleric's player might say, "I'm casting a *cure light wounds* spell on Ruggin."

The character must be able to gesture and speak normally to cast a spell. While casting a spell, the character must remain in one place and concentrate. The character cannot cast spells while walking or running, rowing a boat or poling a raft, and so on. If the character is disturbed (i.e., hit in combat, tackled, etc.) while casting a spell, the spell will be ruined, and will still be "erased" from his mind just as if it had been cast.

Spells must be cast one at a time; a character cannot cast more than one spell at the same time (i.e., no more than one in the same combat round).

Important Note: Unless otherwise noted in a spell description, damage caused by spells is always rolled on six-sided dice. If a character can cast a spell which does six dice of damage, this is customarily 6d6.

The maximum damage produced by *any single spell*—including *fireball*, *lightening bolt*, and *delayed blast fireball*—is 20 dice, of the type specified (usually d6, therefore a maximum of 20d6). This is *very important* for game balance, and should not be ignored.

For example, without this maximum, a 36th level magic-user could instantly slay any other magic-user by surprise, regardless of the results of the saving throw!

## Reading Spell Descriptions

Below, each spell is explained in terms of its range, duration, and effect; these three details are followed by its description.

Range: This is a measure of how far from the spellcaster the magic will reach. The character should be sure, before casting the spell, that the target is within range. If the description says "Range: 0," the spell may only be used on the spellcaster, and cannot be cast on others. If "Range: Touch" is given, the spell can be placed on any creature the spellcaster touches—including the spellcaster himself. If the range listed is a distance, and you're not sure how far from the target your character is, ask the DM if your target is within your spell's range.

Duration: This describes how long the effects of the spell last. A spell's duration is given either in rounds (*each round lasts ten seconds*) or turns (*each turn is ten minutes*). If the description says "Duration: Permanent," then the spell has a permanent effect that does not go away after a given duration (though other spells can sometimes dispel it). If the spell's duration is listed as "Instantaneous," the spell takes effect immediately, though specific spell descriptions will alter its actual duration.

Effect: This gives details on either the number of creatures or objects, or an area or volume of space, which the spell affects; it can also briefly describe what the spell does in short form.

Description: This text explains what the spell does to those it affects.

## Saving Throws vs. Spells

With many magic spells, a character can often resist some of the spell's effects by making a 1d20 roll called a saving throw. A saving throw is the number the character must roll equal to or higher than to successfully "save against a spell." Basically, if your character makes his saving throw, he can either reduce the damage inflicted by the spell or he can partially (or fully) resist the spell's effects, depending on the individual spell.

If a character is allowed to make a saving throw vs. the effects of a spell, the spell description will mention the fact. The spell description also explains the effect of a successful save. You can learn more about saving throws in Chapter 8 on page 109.

## Reversible Spells

Some spells can be cast "reversed," meaning that they result in an effect opposite to the effect normally described for the spell. For example, when a cleric casts a reversed healing spell, it harms the recipient.

*On the spell lists you'll find in this chapter, any spell marked with an asterisk (\*) may be reversed; the spell description will explain what the reversed spell does if it is not self-evident. If a spell name is not marked with an asterisk, the spell is not reversible.*

Magic-users must memorize their spells in the reversed form in order to use them reversed. Clerics, on the other hand, will learn their spells through meditation, and can decide during the casting whether to cast them in proper or reversed form.

## Multiple Spell Effects

Some spells can be used to temporarily improve a character's attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and other abilities.

As a general rule, casting the same spell twice on someone doesn't do any good; the spells' effects do not combine, even if they were cast by two different characters. For instance, two *haste* spells (described further in this chapter) do not combine to allow a target character to attack at four times the normal rate; only the first *haste* will take effect.

*Different* spells, on the other hand, or the effects of spells and magical items, will usually combine successfully. For example, a *bless* spell gives a character a +1 to his attack roll, so does a magical sword with a +1 bonus. If a character with a magical *sword* +1 is *blessed* by a cleric, the two bonuses combine and he has a +2 added to his attack roll (in addition to normal Strength bonuses).

## Clerical Spells

Clerical spells tend to be less flashy than magic-user spells. Clerical magic primarily involves healing, divination of truth, protection from harm, and so forth. Seldom do you see clerical spells as forceful and dramatic as the magic-user's *lightning bolt*. On the other hand, clerics can fight well and don't need such spells.

## Learning Spells

To learn a spell, the cleric meditates, petitioning the power he serves. The memory and details of the spells appear in the cleric's mind. The cleric may cast the spells at any time thereafter. The cleric will remember each spell until it is cast, even if it is not used for days or weeks.

As a player, all you need to do is choose whatever spells you want your character to have. This can only be done when the cleric has had a good night's sleep and immediately has a full hour when he does not have to do anything strenuous.

The cleric can meditate in a certain amount of noise: the sound of a camp readying itself in the morning, the normal bustling of a house or inn, even while people are trying to talk with him. He's not totally cut off from his surroundings, and can put up a hand or say a few words to forestall further interruption. But it's not possible for the cleric to meditate in the middle of a battle.

If the cleric learned spells on a previous day that he no longer wants to have available to him, he can opt to forget them and meditate on new spells.

## Number and Types of Spells

The cleric may know at any one time the number of spells appropriate for his experience level, as shown on the cleric's experience table in Chapter 2.

The cleric may know any clerical spell from the list of clerical spells so long as he is of a high enough experience level to know it and cast it, and so long as the DM has not banned the use of that particular spell in his campaign. The cleric cannot learn a spell from either the druidic spells list or the magical spells list.

## Reversible Spells

A cleric may reverse a spell simply by casting it backward. The player simply says, "My cleric is casting the spell in reverse."

However, lawful clerics prefer not to cast spells in reversed form. They only cast the reversed forms in extreme life-or-death situations.

Chaotic clerics often use the reversed spells, and only use the normal forms to benefit their friends. Neutral clerics can choose to cast the normal or the reversed forms.

## List of Clerical Spells

Following is a list of clerical spells and their descriptions. They're divided up into spell levels and set in alphabetical order. All spells marked with an asterisk (\*) can be cast in reversed form.

### First Level Clerical Spells

#### Cure Light Wounds\*

Range: Touch  
Duration: Permanent  
Effect: Any one living creature

This spell either heals damage or removes paralysis. If used to heal, it can cure 2-7 (1d6 + 1) points of damage. It cannot heal damage if used

to cure paralysis. The cleric may cast it on himself if desired.

This spell cannot increase a creature's total hit points above the original amount.

When reversed, this spell, cause *light wounds*, causes 1d6 + 1 (2-7) points of damage to any creature or character touched (no saving throw is allowed). The cleric must make a normal attack roll to inflict this damage.

#### Detect Evil

Range: 120'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Everything within 120'

When this spell is cast, the cleric will see evilly enchanted objects within 120' glow. It will also cause creatures that want to harm the cleric to glow when they are within range. The actual thoughts of the creatures cannot be heard. Remember that a Chaotic alignment does not automatically mean Evil, although many Chaotic monsters have evil intentions. Traps and poison are neither good nor evil, merely dangerous; this spell does not reveal them.

#### Detect Magic

Range: 0

Duration: 2 turns

Effect: Everything within 60'

When this spell is cast, the cleric will see a glow around magical objects, creatures, and places within the spell's effect. The glow will not last very long; clerics should normally use the spell only when they want to know if particular objects already within sight are, in fact, magical. For example, a door may be held shut magically, a stranger might actually be an enchanted monster, or a treasure might be enchanted.

#### Light\*

Range: 120'

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: Volume of 30' diameter

This spell creates a large ball of light, as if cast by a bright torch or lamp. If the spell is cast on an object (such as the cleric's weapon), the light will move with the object.

If the spell is cast at a creature's eyes, the victim must make a saving throw vs. spell. If he fails the saving throw, the victim will be blinded by the light for the duration of the spell, or until the spell effect is canceled.

When reversed, this spell, *darkness*, creates a circle of darkness 30' in diameter. *Darkness* will cancel a sight except infravision. *Darkness* will cancel a *light* spell if cast upon it, but may itself be canceled by another *light* spell. If cast at an opponent's eyes, *darkness* causes blindness for the duration of the spell or until canceled. If the target makes a successful saving throw vs. spell, the spell misses.

#### Protection from Evil

Range: 0

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: The cleric only

This spell creates an invisible magical barrier all around the cleric's body (less than an inch

![Decorative header image with floral patterns.]()![](_page_34_Picture_0.jpeg)

## Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative header image with floral patterns.]()![](_page_34_Picture_2.jpeg)

away). While the spell lasts, characters and monsters attacking the cleric are penalized by -1 to their attack rolls, and the cleric gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws.

In addition, enchanted creatures cannot even touch the cleric! (An enchanted creature is one that normal weapons will not affect, one which only magical weapons can hit. A creature that can only be hit by a silver weapon—a werewolf, for example—is not an enchanted creature. Any creature that is magically summoned or controlled, such as a *charmed* character, is also considered to be an enchanted creature.) The barrier thus completely protects the cleric from all melee or hand-to-hand attacks from such creatures; however, it cannot prevent attacks from missile weapons. Enchanted creatures using missile weapons still suffer the -1 penalty to the attack roll, but they *can* hit the cleric.

This spell will not affect a *magic missile* spell used by magic-users.

If the cleric attacks an enchanted creature during the spell's duration, the spell's effect changes slightly. Enchanted creatures are then able to touch the magic-user, but still suffer the attack roll penalty; the penalty and the cleric's saving throw adjustments still apply until the spell duration ends.

### Purify Food and Water

Range: 10'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: See below

This spell will make spoiled or poisoned food and water safe and usable. It will purify one ration of preserved food (either iron or standard rations), or six waterskins of water, or enough normal food to feed a dozen people. If cast at mud, the spell will cause the dirt to settle, leaving a pool of pure, clear water. The spell will not affect any living creature.

### Remove Fear\*

Range: Touch

Duration: 2 turns

Effect: Any one living creature

When the cleric casts this spell and then touches any living creature, the spell will calm the creature and remove any fear. If the creature has been affected by a *fear* spell or effect which does not normally allow a saving throw, the *remove fear* spell can still be useful. If the cleric casts the spell on someone afflicted by a magical fear effect, the victim gets to make a saving throw vs. spells, adding a bonus to the roll equal to the cleric's level of experience (up to a maximum bonus of +6). If the saving throw is successful, the victim's fear is negated. Regardless of the cleric's level or any bonuses, a roll of 1 will always fail.

The reversed form of the spell, *cause fear*, will make any one creature flee for two turns. The victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. This reversed spell has a range of 120'.

### Resist Cold

Range: 0

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: All creatures within 30'

When this spell is cast, all creatures within 30' of the cleric can withstand freezing temperatures without harm. In addition, those affected gain a bonus of +2 to all saving throws against cold attacks. Furthermore, any damage from cold is reduced by 1 point per die of damage (but with a minimum of 1 point of damage per die). The effect will move with the cleric.

## Second Level Clerical Spells

### Bless\*

Range: 60'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: All within a 20' square area

This spell improves the morale of friendly creatures by +1 and gives the recipients a +1 bonus on all attack and damage rolls. It will only affect creatures in a 20' X 20' area, and only those who are not yet in melee.

When reversed, this spell, *blight*, places a -1 penalty on enemies' morale, attack rolls, and damage rolls. Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the penalties.

### Find Traps

Range: 0 (Cleric only)

Duration: 2 turns

Effect: Traps within 30' glow

This spell causes all mechanical and magical traps to glow with a dull blue light when the cleric comes within 30' of them. It does not reveal the types of traps, nor any method of removing them. Note that an ambush is not a trap, nor is a natural hazard, such as quicksand.

### Hold Person\*

Range: 180'

Duration: 9 turns

Effect: Paralyzes up to 4 creatures

The *hold person* spell will affect any human, demihuman, or human-like creature (bugbear, dryad, gnoll, hobgoblin, kobold, lizard man, ogre, orc, nixie, pixie or sprite, for instance). It will not affect the undead or creatures larger than ogres. Each victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or be paralyzed for nine turns. The spell may be cast at a single person or at a group. If cast at a single person, the victim suffers a -2 penalty to the saving throw. If cast at a group, it will affect up to four persons (of the cleric's choice), but with no penalty to their rolls. The paralysis may only be removed by the reversed form of the spell, or by a *dispel magic* spell.

The reverse of the spell, *free person*, removes the paralysis of up to four victims of the normal form of the spell (including *hold person* cast by a magic-user or an elf). It has no other effect; it does not, for instance, remove the effects of a goul's paralysis ability.

### Know Alignment\*

Range: 0 (Cleric only)

Duration: 1 round

Effect: One creature within 10'

The caster of this spell may discover the alignment (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic) of any one creature within 10'. The spell may also be used

to find the alignment of an enchanted item or area (if any).

The reverse of the spell, *confuse alignment*, lasts for one turn per level of the caster, and may be cast on any one creature, by touch. No saving throw is allowed. For as long as the spell lasts, a cleric trying to identify the alignment of the recipient by using the normal *know alignment* spell will get a false answer. That same false answer will be the result of any further attempts.

### Resist Fire

Range: 30'

Duration: 2 turns

Effect: One living creature

For the duration of this spell, normal fire and heat cannot harm the spell's recipient. The recipient also gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against magical fire (dragon's breath, *fireball*, etc.). Furthermore, damage from such fire is reduced by 1 point per die of damage (though each die will inflict at least 1 point of damage, regardless of adjustments). Red dragon breath damage is reduced by 1 point per Hit Die of the creature (again, to no less than 1 point of damage per Hit Die).

### Silence 15' Radius

Range: 180'

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: Sphere of silence 30' across

This spell makes the area of effect totally silent. Conversation and spellcasting in this area are impossible for the duration of the spell. This spell does not prevent a person within the area from hearing noises outside the area. If cast on a creature, the victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or the spell effects will move with the creature. If the saving throw is successful, the spell remains in the area in which it was cast, and the victim may move out of the area.

### Snake Charm

Range: 60'

Duration: 2-5 rounds or 2-5 turns

Effect: Charms 1 HD of snakes per level of the caster

With this spell, a cleric may charm 1 Hit Die of snakes for each level of experience he has, and no saving throw is allowed. A 5th level cleric could *charm* one 5 HD snake, five 1 HD snakes, or any combination totalling 5 Hit Dice or less. The snakes affected will rise up and sway, but will not attack unless attacked themselves.

If the cleric uses the spell on snakes attacking him, the spell's duration is 1d4 + 1 (2-5) rounds; otherwise, it lasts 1d4 + 1 (2-5) turns. When the spell wears off, the snakes return to normal (but with normal reactions; they will not be automatically hostile).

### Speak with Animals

Range: 0 (Cleric only)

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Allows conversation within 30'

When casting this spell, the cleric must name one type of animal (such as wolves). For the duration of the spell, the cleric may speak with all

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_35_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_35_Picture_2.jpeg)

animals of that type if they are within 30'; the effect moves with the caster.

The cleric can speak to any normal or giant forms of the specific animal type named, but only to one type at a time. The caster may not use this spell to speak to intelligent animals and fantastic creatures.

The creatures spoken to usually have favorable reactions (+2 bonus to the reaction roll), and they can be talked into doing a favor for the cleric if the reaction roll is high enough. The animal must be able to understand the request and must be able to perform it.

## Third Level Clerical Spells

### Continual Light\*

Range: 120'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Sphere of light 60' across

This spell creates light as bright as daylight in a spherical volume of 30' radius. It lasts until a *dispel magic* or *continual darkness* spell is cast upon it. Creatures penalized in bright daylight suffer the same penalties within this spell effect (for example, goblinks, which suffer a -1 attack roll penalty in daylight, suffer the same penalty within the effect of *continual light*).

If the spell is cast on an opponent's eyes, the victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or be blinded until the effect is removed. This spell may be cast in an area, upon an object, or on a person or creature; it can also be cast directly on a person's or creature's eyes, thus blinding him.

The reverse of this spell, *continual darkness*, creates a completely dark volume of the same size. Torches, lanterns, and even a *light* spell will not affect it, and inviravision cannot penetrate it. A *continual light* spell will, however, cancel it. If cast on a creature's eyes, the creature must make a saving throw vs. spells or be blinded (with the same effects as blindness from the normal *continual light* until the spell is removed).

### Cure Blindness

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: One living creature

This spell will cure nearly any form of blindness, including those caused by *light* or *darkness* spells (whether normal or continual). It will not, however, affect blindness caused by a curse.

### Cure Disease\*

Range: 30'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: One living creature within range

This spell will cure any living creature of one disease, such as those caused by a mummy or green slime. If cast by a cleric of 11th level or greater, this spell will also cure lycanthropy.

The reverse of this spell, *cause disease*, infects the victim with a hideous wasting disease unless he successfully makes a saving throw vs. spells. A diseased victim has a -2 penalty on all attack rolls. In addition, the victim's wounds cannot be magically cured, and natural healing takes twice as long as usual. The disease is fatal in 2d12 (2-24) days unless removed by a *cure disease* spell.

### Growth of Animal

Range: 120'

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: Doubles the size of one animal

This spell doubles the size of one normal or giant animal. The animal then has twice its normal strength and inflicts double its normal damage. It may also carry twice its normal encumbrance. This spell does not change an animal's behavior, armor class, or hit points, and does not affect intelligent animal races or fantastic creatures.

### Locate Object

Range: 0 (Cleric only)

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Detects one object within 120'

This spell allows the cleric to sense the direction of one known object. It gives no information about distance. It can detect a common object with only a partial description (such as "stairs leading up") but it will only reveal the direction to the closest such object. To find a specific object, the cleric must *know* exactly what the object looks like (size, shape, color, etc.). The spell will not locate a creature.

### Remove Curse\*

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Removes any one curse

This spell removes one curse, whether on a character, item, or area. Some curses—especially those on magical items—may only be removed for a short time, at the DM's discretion; such curses would require a *dispel evil* spell for permanent removal (or possibly a *remove curse* cast by a high level cleric or magic-user, again at DM's discretion).

The reverse of this spell, *curse*, causes a misfortune or penalty to affect the victim. Curses are limited only by the caster's imagination, but if an attempted curse is too powerful, it may return to the caster (DM's discretion)! Safe limits to curses may include: -4 penalty on attack rolls; -2 penalty on saving throws; prime requisite reduced to half normal; -4 penalty on others' reduction rolls to him. The victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the curse.

### Speak with the Dead

Range: 10'

Duration: 1 round per level of the cleric

Effect: Cleric may ask three questions

By means of this spell, a cleric may ask three questions of a deceased spirit if the body is within range.

A cleric of 6th or 7th level can contact recently deceased spirits (those dead up to 4 days). Clerics of levels 8-14 have slightly more power (contacting spirits up to 4 months dead), and clerics of levels 15-20 have even more (speaking with corpses up to 4 years dead). No time limits apply to clerics of 21st level or greater.

The spirit will always reply in a tongue known to the cleric, but can only offer knowledge of things up to the time of its death. If the spirit's alignment is the same as the cleric's, it will pro-

vide clear and brief answers; however, if the alignments differ, the spirit may reply in riddles.

### Striking

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 turn

Effect: 1d6 bonus to damage on 1 weapon

This spell allows any one weapon to inflict 1d6 *additional points of damage per attack* (like a *magical staff of striking*). The weapon will inflict this extra damage with every successful blow for as long as the spell lasts. This bonus does not apply to attack rolls, but only to damage rolls.

If the cleric casts this spell on a normal weapon, the weapon may then damage creatures which are normally affected only by magic weapons; the weapon will do 1d6 points of damage per strike (regardless of the normal damage of the weapon).

## Fourth Level Clerical Spells

### Animate Dead

Range: 60'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates zombies or skeletons

This spell allows the caster to make animated, enchanted skeletons or zombies from normal skeletons or dead bodies within range. These animated undead creatures will obey the cleric until they are destroyed by another cleric or a *dispel magic* spell.

For each experience level of the cleric, he may animate one Hit Die of undead. A skeleton has the same Hit Dice as the original creature, but a zombie has one Hit Die more than the original. Note that this *doesn't* count character experience levels as Hit Dice: For purposes of this spell, all humans and demihumans are 1 HD creatures, so the remains of a 9th level thief would be animated as a zombie with 2 HD.

Animated creatures do not have any spells, but are immune to *sleep* and *charm* effects and poison. Lawful clerics must take care to use this spell only for good purpose. Animating the dead is usually a Chaotic act.

### Create Water

Range: 10'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Creates one magical spring

With this spell, the cleric summons forth an enchanted spring from the ground or a wall. The spring will flow for an hour, creating enough water for 12 men and their mounts (for that day, about 50 gallons). For each of the cleric's experience levels above 8, water for twelve additional men and mounts is created; thus a 10th level cleric could create water for 36 men and horses.

The cleric doesn't have to create the maximum amount of water if he doesn't wish to. He might wish to create a spring which will flow for half an hour, or a few minutes; the player need only tell the GM how many gallons he wants the spell to create, up to the spell's maximum.

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

## Cure Serious Wounds\*

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Any one living creature

This spell is similar to a cure *light wounds* spell, but will cure one creature of 2d6 + 2 (4-14) points of damage.

The reverse of this spell, cause *serious wounds*, causes 2d6 + 2 points of damage to any creature or character touched (no saving throw). The caster must make a normal attack roll to successfully cast the *cause serious wounds* spell.

## Dispel Magic

Range: 120'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Destroys spells in a 20' cube

This spell destroys other spell effects in a cubic volume of 20' x 20' x 20'. It does not affect magical items. Spell effects created by a caster (whether cleric, druid, magic-user, or elf) of a level equal to or lower than the caster of the *dispel magic* are automatically and immediately destroyed. Spell effects created by a higher-level caster might not be affected. The chance of failure is 5% per level of difference between the casters. For example, a 7th level cleric trying to dispel a *web* spell cast by a 9th level magic-user would have a 10% chance of failure.

*Dispel magic* will not affect a magical item (such as a scroll, a magical sword, etc.). However, it can dispel the effects of the magical item when that item is used (for example, a spellcaster can cast *dispel magic* on the victim of a *ring of human control* and snap him out of that control, or on a flaming weapon to douse the flame).

## Neutralize Poison\*

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: A creature, container, or object

This spell will make poison harmless either in a creature, a container (such as a bottle), or on one object (such as a chest). It will even revive a victim slain by poison if cast within 10 rounds of the poisoning!

The spell will affect any and all poisons present at the time it is cast, but does not cure any damage (and will thus not revive a poisoned victim who has died of wounds).

The reverse of this spell, *create poison*, may be cast, by touch, on a creature or container. A cleric cannot cast it on any other object. A victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or be immediately slain by the poison. If cast on a container, the spell poisons its contents; no saving throw applies, even for magical containers or contents (such as potions). (Of course, when someone drinks those poisoned contents, he gets a saving throw.) Using *create poison*, or poisoning in any case, is usually a Chaotic act.

## Protection from Evil 10' Radius

Range: 0

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: Barrier 20' diameter

This spell creates an invisible magical barrier all around the caster, extending for a 10' radius

in all directions. The spell serves as protection from attacks by monsters of an alignment other than the caster's. Each creature within the barrier gains a +1 to all saving throws, and all attacks against those within are penalized by -1 to the attacker's attack roll while the spell lasts.

In addition, enchanted creatures cannot attack those within the barrier in hand-to-hand (meele) combat. (An enchanted creature is any creature which is magically summoned or controlled, such as a *charmed* character, or one that is not harmed by normal weapons. A creature that can be hit only by a silver weapon—a werewolf, for example—is not an enchanted creature.)

If anyone within the barrier attacks an enchanted creature, the barrier will no longer prevent the creature from attacking hand-to-hand, but the bonus to saving throws and penalty to attack rolls will still apply.

Attackers, including enchanted creatures, can attack people inside the barrier by using missile or magical attacks. They do suffer the —1 penalty to attack rolls, but that is the only penalty they suffer.

## Speak with Plants

Range: 0 (Cleric only)

Duration: 3 turns

Effect: All plants within 30'

This spell enables the cleric to talk to plants as though they are intelligent. The cleric may request a simple favor, and the plants will grant it if it is within the plants' power to understand and perform. This spell may be used to allow the cleric and party to pass through otherwise impenetrable undergrowth. It will also allow the cleric to communicate with plantlike monsters (such as treants).

## Sticks to Snakes

Range: 120'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Up to 16 sticks

This spell turns 2d8 sticks into snakes (detailed below). The snakes may be poisonous (50% chance per snake; the DM can roll 1d6 for each snake; on a roll of 1-3, the snake is poisonous). They obey the cleric's commands, but will turn back into sticks when slain or when the spell's duration ends.

Snakes: NA 2d8 (2d8); AC 6, HD 1; AT 1 bite; DMg 1d4; MV 90' (30'); Save F1; ML 12; TT Nil; AL Neutral; SA poison (50% chance for each snake to be poisonous); XP 10 (non-poisonous) or 13 (poisonous).

## Fifth Level Clerical Spells

### Commune

Range: 0 (Cleric only)

Duration: 3 turns

Effect: 3 questions

This spell allows the cleric to ask questions of the greater powers (whatever forces of nature, greater spirits, or legendary Immortals the DM has created for this campaign world). The cleric may ask three questions that can be answered "yes" or "no."

A cleric may *commune* only once a week. If the clerics in the campaign are using the spell too often, the DM may wish to limit its use to once a month. Once a year the cleric may ask twice the normal number of questions. The DM might wish to establish that this must occur on a day which is significant to the greater powers being questioned.

## Create Food

Range: 10'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates food for 12 or more

This spell creates enough normal food to feed up to 12 men and their mounts for one day. For every level of the cleric above 8th, the spell creates enough food for 12 additional men and mounts. The cleric doesn't have to create the maximum amount of food if he doesn't wish to; he can create a lesser amount. Created food spoils after 24 hours; therefore it is impossible to lay in a big store of food created by this spell.

## Cure Critical Wounds\*

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Any one living creature

This spell is similar to a cure *light wounds* spell, but will cure one living creature of 3d6 + 3 (6-21) points of damage.

The reverse of this spell (cause *critical wounds*) causes 3d6 + 3 (6-21) points of damage to any living creature or character touched (no saving throw). The caster must make a normal attack roll to cause the critical wound.

## Dispel Evil

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 turn

Effect: Enchanted or undead monsters or one curse or *charm*

This spell may affect all undead and enchanted (summoned, controlled, and animated) monsters within range. It will destroy the monster unless each victim makes a saving throw vs. spells. If cast at only one creature, that creature takes a —2 penalty to the saving throw. Any creature from another plane is banished (forced to return to its home plane) if it fails the saving throw. Even if the victims successfully roll their saving throws, they must flee the area, and will stay away as long as the caster concentrates; the caster cannot move while concentrating.

This spell will also remove the curse from any one cursed item, or may be used to remove the influence of any magical *charm*.

## Insect Plague

Range: 480'

Duration: 1 day

Effect: Creates a swarm of 30' radius

This spell summons a vast swarm of insects. The swarm obscures vision and drives off creatures of less than 3 Hit Dice (no saving throw). The swarm moves at up to 20' per round as directed by the cleric while it is within range. The caster must concentrate, without moving, to control the swarm. If the caster is disturbed, the

![Decorative header image]()![](_page_37_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative header image]()![](_page_37_Picture_2.jpeg)

insects scatter and the spell ends. This spell only works outdoors and above-ground.

## Quest\*

Range: 30'

Duration: Special

Effect: Compels one living creature

This spell forces the victim to perform some special task or quest, as commanded by the caster. The victim may make a saving throw vs. spells; if he succeeds, the spell does not affect him.

A typical task might involve slaying a certain monster, rescuing a prisoner, obtaining a magical item for the caster, or going on a pilgrimage. If the task is impossible or suicidal, the spell has no effect. Once the task is completed, the spell ends.

The spell forces the victim to undertake a task, but doesn't force him to *like* it. Once the task is accomplished, the victim might wish to exact revenge on the cleric, just depending on the circumstances of the adventure. Any victim refusing to go on the *quest* is *cursed* until the *quest* is continued. The type of curse is decided by the DM, but may be double normal strength.

The reverse of this spell, *remove quest*, may be used to dispel an unwanted *quest* or a quest-related curse. The chance of success is 50%, modified by 5% for every level of the caster differs from the level of the caster of the first *quest*. Thus, an 11th level cleric attempting to remove a quest cast by a 13th level cleric has only a 40% chance of success; a 36th level cleric attempting to remove a *quest* cast by a 20th level cleric has a 130% chance (reduced to 99% to provide for a 1% chance of failure).

## Raise Dead\*

Range: 120'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Body of one human or demihuman

By means of this spell, the cleric can raise any human, dwarf, halfling, or elf from the dead. The body must be present, and if part is missing, the raised character will be disabled accordingly.

An 8th level cleric can raise a body that has been dead for up to four days. For each level of the cleric above 8th, add four days to this time. Thus, a 10th level cleric can raise bodies that have been dead for up to twelve days.

The recipient returns to life with 1 hit point, and cannot fight, cast spells, use abilities, carry heavy loads, or move at more than half speed. These penalties will disappear after two full weeks of complete bed rest, but the healing cannot be speeded by magic.

The cleric may also cast this spell at any one undead creature within range. The undead creature will be destroyed unless it makes a saving throw vs. spells with a -2 penalty. However, a vampire which fails its saving throw is not destroyed, merely forced to retreat to its coffin, in gaseous form, as fast as possible. When cast at an undead creature of more Hit Dice than a vampire, this spell inflicts 3d10 (3-30) points of damage. The creature can make a saving throw vs. spells to take half damage.

The reverse of this spell, *finger of death*, creates a death ray that will kill any one living crea-

ture within 60'. The victim may make a saving throw vs. death ray to avoid the effect. A lawful cleric will only use *finger of death* in a life-or-death situation. *Finger of death* will actually cure 3d10 (3-30) points of damage for any undead with 10 or more Hit Dice (phantom, haunt, spirit, nightshade, or special).

## Truesight

Range: 0 (cleric only)

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level of caster.

Effect: Reveals all things

When he casts this spell, the cleric is able to see all things within 120'. The spell is quite powerful; the cleric can clearly see all hidden, invisible, and ethereal objects and creatures as with the magic-user *detect invisible* spell. In addition, any secret doors as well as things or creatures not in their true form—whether *polymorphed*, disguised, or otherwise—are seen as they truly are, with no possibility of deception. Alignment is also "seen," as is experience and power.

## Sixth Level Clerical Spells

### Aerial Servant

Range: 60'

Duration: 1 day per level of caster

Effect: Servant fetches one item or creature

An aerial servant is a very intelligent being from the elemental plane. With this spell, the cleric summons one of these beings, which appears immediately. The cleric must then describe one creature or item and its location to the servant, or else it will depart. When it hears this description and location, the aerial servant leaves, trying to find the item or creature and bring it to the cleric. The servant will take as much time as needed, up to the limit of the duration. If the spell's duration lapses before the task is completed, even if the aerial servant is already bringing the target back to the caster, the aerial servant has failed to accomplish its task. See below for further details.

The aerial servant has 18 Strength, and can carry up to 500 lbs (5,000 cn). It can become ethereal at will, and thus can travel to most places easily. However, it cannot pass through a *protection from evil* spell effect.

If it cannot perform its duty within the duration of the spell, the servant becomes insane and returns to attack the caster.

See Chapter 14 for a full description of the aerial servant.

### Animate Objects

Range: 60'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Causes objects to move

The cleric may use this spell to cause any non-living, nonmagical objects to move and attack. Magical objects are not affected. The spell can animate any one object up to 400 lbs (4,000 cn) (roughly the size of two men), or a number of smaller objects whose total weight does not exceed 400 lbs.

The DM must decide on the movement rate, number of attacks, damage, and other combat

details of the objects animated. As a guideline, a man-sized statue might move at 30' per round, attack once per round for 2d8 (2-16) points of damage, and have an armor class of 1. A chair might only be AC 6, but move at 180' per round on its four legs, attacking twice per round for 1d4 points per attack. All objects have the same chances to hit as the cleric animating them.

### Barrier\*

Range: 60'

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: Creates whirling hammers

This spell creates a magical barrier in an area up to 30' in diameter and 30' high. The *barrier* is a wall of whirling and dancing hammers, obviously dangerous to any who come in contact with it. Any creature passing through the barrier takes 7d10 (7-70) points of damage from the whirling hammers (no saving throw allowed). This spell is often used to block an entrance or passage.

The reverse of this spell (remove *barrier*) will destroy any one barrier created by a cleric. It can also be used to destroy a magic-user's *wall of fire*, *wall of ice*, *clothform*, *woodform*, or *wall of stone* spell effects. It will not affect the magic-user spells *wall of iron*, *stoneform*, *ironform* or *steelform*.

### Create Normal Animals

Range: 30'

Duration: 10 turns

Effect: Creates 1-6 loyal animals

The cleric is able to create normal animals from thin air with this spell. The animals will appear at a point chosen (within 30'), but may thereafter be sent (by command) up to 240' away, if desired. The animals created will understand and obey the cleric at all times. They will fight if so commanded, and will perform other actions (carrying, watching, etc.) to the best of their abilities. They are normal animals, and may attack others unless their instructions are carefully worded.

The cleric may choose the number of animals created, but not the exact type; the DM should decide, or even randomly determine, what sort of animals appear. The spell will create one large animal (elephant, hippopotamus, etc.), three medium-sized animals (bear, great cat, etc.), or six small animals (wolf, rock baboon, etc.). The spell cannot create giant animals. The animals disappear when slain or when the spell duration ends.

### Cureall

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Cures anything

This spell is the most powerful of the healing spells. When used to cure wounds, it cures nearly all damage, leaving the recipient with only 1d6 points of damage. (Restore the victim to full starting hit points, then roll 1d6 and subtract that amount from the victim's hit point total.)

The spell can remove a curse, neutralize a poison, cure paralysis, cure a disease, cure blindness, or even remove a *feeblemind* effect instead

![Decorative floral border]()![](_page_38_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative floral border]()![](_page_38_Picture_2.jpeg)

of healing. However, it will cure one thing only; if the recipient is suffering from two or more afflictions (such as wounds and a curse), the cleric must name the ailment the spell is intended to cure.

If cast on the recipient of a *raise dead* spell, the *curseall* eliminates the need for two weeks of bed rest; the recipient can immediately function normally. This is the only form of magical curing that will work on a newly-raised creature.

## Find the Path

Range: 0 (Cleric only)

Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn per level of the caster  
Effect: Shows the path to an area

When casting this spell, the cleric must name a specific place, though it need not be a place he has visited before. For the duration of the spell, the cleric knows the direction to that place. In addition, the cleric will magically gain any special knowledge needed to get to the place; for example, he would know the location of secret doors, passwords, and so forth.

When the spell's duration runs out, the caster only remembers the general direction to the place. All other special information is forgotten. The spell is instantly negated is the caster attempts to write down, record, or disclose that special knowledge to others. This spell is often used to find a fast escape route.

## Speak with Monsters\*

Range: 0 (Cleric only)

Duration: 1 round per level of the cleric

Effect: Permits conversation with any monster

This spell gives the caster the power to ask questions of any and all living and undead creatures within 30'. Even unintelligent monsters will understand and respond to the cleric. Those spoken to will not attack the cleric while engaged in conversation, but may defend themselves or flee if attacked. The cleric may ask only one question per round, and the spell lasts one round per level of the caster.

The reverse of this spell, *babble*, has a 60' range, a duration of 1 turn per level of the caster, and affects one target within spell range. The victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect, but with a —2 penalty to the roll. If he fails the saving throw, the victim cannot communicate with any other creature for the duration of the spell. Even hand motions, written notes, telepathy, and all other forms of communication will seem garbled. This does not interfere with the victim's spellcasting (if any), but does prevent him from using any magical items which are activated by command words—the command words turn into gibberish.

## Word of Recall

Range: 0 (Cleric only)

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Teleports the caster to sanctuary

Similar to a magic-user's *teleport* spell, this spell carries the cleric and all equipment carried (but no other creatures) to the cleric's home, regardless of the distance. The cleric must have a permanent home (such as a castle), and a meditation room within that home; this room is the

destination when the spell is cast. During the round in which this spell is cast, the cleric automatically gains initiative unless surprised.

## Seventh Level Clerical Spells

### Earthquake

Range: 120 yards

Duration: 1 turn

Effect: Causes earth tremors

This powerful spell causes a section of earth to shake, and opens large cracks in the ground. A 17' level caster can affect an area up to 60' square, adding 5' to each dimension with each experience level above 17th. For example, an 18th level cleric affects an area up to 65' square; 19th level, 70' square; and so forth.

Within the area of effect, all small dwellings are reduced to rubble, and larger constructions are cracked open. Earthen formations (hills, cliffsides, etc.) form rockslides. Cracks in the earth may open and engulf 1 creature in 6 (determined randomly), crushing them (when the die roll randomly determines that a character is in danger of falling into a crack and being crushed, the character gets a saving throw vs. death to escape falling in).

### Holy Word

Range: 0

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: All creatures within 40'

This spell affects all creatures, friend or foe, within a circular area of 40' radius, centered on the caster. When the cleric casts this spell, all creatures of alignments other than the cleric's are affected as follows (no saving throw vs. spells allowed):

### Holy Word Effects

Up to 5th Level:

Killed

Level 6-8:

Stunned 2d10 turns

Level 9-12:

Deafened 1d6 turns

Level 13 +:

Stunned 1d10 rounds

Any victim of 13th level (or Hit Dice) or higher, or any victim of the same alignment as the caster, may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid all spell effects. This powerful spell cannot be blocked by stone, nor by any other solid material except lead. It *can*, however, be blocked by an *anti-magic shell*.

### Raise Dead Fully\*

Range: 60'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Raises any living creature

This spell is similar to the 5th level spell *raise dead*, except that it can *raise* any living creature—not just humans and demihumans. Any human or demihuman recipient awakens immediately, with full hit points, and is able to fight, use abilities, spells known, etc., without any penalties—except those penalties the creature already possessed at the time of death. For example, a victim *cursed* or *diseased* at death would still suffer the affliction when *raised fully*.

If any other living creature (other than a human or demihuman) is the recipient, the guide-

lines given in the *raise dead* spell apply (including time limitations, rest needed, etc.).

A 17th level cleric can use this spell on a human or demihuman body that has been dead up to 4 months; for each level of experience above 17th, this time increases 4 months. Thus, a 19th level cleric could cast *raise dead fully* on a body that has been dead up to 12 months.

The spell is fatal to undead. Cast on an undead creature of 7 Hit Dice or less, the spell immediately destroys the creature (no saving throw). The spell forces an undead creature of 7 to 12 Hit Dice to make a saving throw vs. spells, with a —4 penalty to the roll; if the creature fails the roll, it is destroyed. The spell inflicts 6d10 (6-60) points of damage upon an undead monster of more than 12 Hit Dice, but the victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to take half damage.

The reverse of this spell (*obliterate*) will affect a living creature just as the normal form affects undead (destroy 7 Hit Dice or less, et al.). If cast at an undead creature of any type, *obliterate* has the same effect as a *curseall* would on a living creature (curing all but 1d6 points of damage, or curing blindness or *feeblemind*, etc.).

### Restore\*

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Restores 1 level lost to *energy drain*

This spell restores one full level of energy (experience) to any victim who has lost a level because of *energy drain* (for instance, from a vampire's attack). It does not *restore* more than one level, nor does it add a level if no level has been lost. Furthermore, the cleric casting this spell loses one level of experience, as if struck by a wight when the spell is cast; however, the cleric's loss is *not* permanent, and the cleric need only rest for 2d10 (2-20) days to regain the lost experience.

The reverse of this spell, *life drain*, drains one level of experience from the victim touched, just like the touch of a wight or wraith. Casting the reversed spell causes no experience level loss to the cleric, nor does it require any rest afterward, but it is a Chaotic act, avoided by Lawful clerics.

### Survival

Range: Touch

Duration: One hour per level of the caster

Effect: Protects one creature against all non-magical damage from the environment

This spell protects the recipient from adverse conditions of all types, including normal heat or cold, lack of air, and so forth. While die spell is in effect, the caster needs no air, food, water, or sleep. The spell does not protect against magical damage of any type, attack damage, poisons, breath weapons, or physical blows from creatures. It does protect against all damage caused by natural conditions on other planes of existence.

For example, a cleric might use this spell: in a desert or blizzard to prevent damage from the natural conditions; underground or underwater, enabling survival without air; in space, to magically survive in vacuum; or on the elemental plane of Fire, to protect against conditional fire damage.

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_39_Picture_2.jpeg)

## Travel

Range: 0

Duration: One turn per level of the caster

Effect: Allows aerial or gaseous travel

This spell allows the cleric to move quickly and freely, even between the planes of existence. The caster (only) may *fly* in the same manner as given by the magic-user's spell, at a rate of 360' (120'). The cleric can also enter a nearby plane of existence, simply by concentrating for one round. He may enter a maximum of one plane per turn.

The cleric may bring one other creature for every five levels of experience (rounded down; for example, a 29th level cleric could bring five other creatures on the journey). To bring others, he must touch them, or they must touch him, while the spell is cast and the shift is made. Any unwilling creature can make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. The cleric must take the others with him—he cannot send them while remaining behind.

While this spell is in effect, the caster (only) may assume *gaseous form* by concentrating for one full round. (If he is interrupted, no change occurs.) Unlike the potion effect, all equipment carried also becomes part of the same *gaseous* cloud. In this form, the caster may travel at double the normal flying rate: 720' (240'). While *gaseous*, the cleric cannot use items or cast spells, but also cannot be damaged except by magic (weapons or certain spells). Also, *gaseous* being cannot pass through a *protection from evil* spell effect or an *anti-magic shell*.

## Wish

Range: Special

Duration: Special

Effect: Special

A *wish* is the single most powerful spell a cleric can have. It is never found on a scroll, but may be placed elsewhere (in a ring, for example) in rare cases. Only clerics of 36th level and with an 18 (or greater) Wisdom score may cast the *wish* spell.

 *wording the Wish*: The player must say or write the exact *wish* his character makes. The wording is very important. The *wish* will usually follow the literal wording, and whatever the intentions of the cleric.

The DM should try to maintain game balance, being neither too generous nor too stingy in deciding the effects of a *wish*. Even a badly phrased *wish*, made with good intentions, may have good results. However, if the *wish* is greedy, or made with malicious intent, the DM should make every effort to distort the results of the spell so that the caster does not profit from it. If necessary, the DM can even disallow the *wish*; it would then have no effect. Whenever a *wish* fails or is misinterpreted, the DM should explain (after the game) the problem or flaw in the phrasing.

Here are some examples of faulty wishes:

"I wish that I knew everything about this dungeon" could result in the character knowing all for only a second, and then forgetting it.

"I wish for a million gold pieces" can be granted by having them land on the character (that's 100,000 pounds of gold!), and then vanish.

"I wish to immediately and permanently pos-

sess the gaze power of a basilisk while retaining all of my own abilities and items" is a carefully worded *wish* that's out of balance. Characters able to use these high-level spells are already quite powerful. This *wish* could result in the character growing a basilisk head in addition to the character's own head.

A *wish* cannot be used to gain either experience points or levels of experience.

*Possible Effects*: A properly worded *wish* can substitute for any other magical spell of 8th level or less, or any clerical or druidic spell of 6th level or less, at the DM's discretion. This common use of a *wish* is more likely to succeed with little chance for error than other uses of the spell. Otherwise, if the *wish* is used to harm another creature, the victim may make a saving throw vs. spells. If the save is successful, the victim takes half the ill effects and the other half rebounds on the caster (who may also save to avoid it, but with a -4 penalty to the roll). If the *wish* will inconvenience someone without harming him (for example, by causing him to *teleport* into a prison cell), the victim gets no saving throw.

A character can use a *wish* to gain treasure, up to a maximum of 50,000 gold pieces per *wish*. However, the caster loses 1 experience point per gold piece value of treasure gained, and this loss cannot be magically restored.

The cleric can use a *wish* to temporarily change any one ability score to a minimum of 3 or maximum of 18. This effect lasts for only six turns.

Wishes can also be used to permanently increase ability scores, but the cost is very high: *You* must cast as many *wishes* as the number of the ability score desired. All the *wishes* must be cast within a one-week period.

You may raise an ability score only one point at a time. To raise your Strength from 15 to 16 takes 16 wishes. To then raise it to 17 will take an additional 17 wishes. Wishes cannot permanently lower ability scores.

A *wish* cannot raise the maximum experience level for human characters; 36th level is an absolute limit. However, one *wish* can allow demi-humans to gain one additional Hit Die (for a new maximum of 9 for halflings, 11 for elves, and 13 for dwarves). This affects only hit points, and does not change any other scores (such as attack rolls, elves' number of spells, etc.).

A *wish* can change a demi-human to a human, or the reverse. Such a change is permanent, and the recipient does not become magical. Half-lings and dwarves become fighters of the same level. Elves become magic-users or fighters (but not both), at the choice of the caster of the *wish*. The changed character would then gain levels of experience normally. A human changes to the same level demi-human, but no higher than the normal racial maximum.

If one character casts a *wish* to change another's character class, the victim (at his option) may make a saving throw vs. spells with a +5 bonus to resist the change.

A *wish* can sometimes change the results of a past occurrence. This is normally limited to events of the previous day. A lost battle may be won, or the losses may be made far less severe, but impossible odds cannot be overcome completely. A death could be changed to a near-death survival; a permanent loss could be made

temporary. The DM may wish to advise players when their *wishes* exceed the limit of the spell's power (or his patience).

*Important Note*: Whenever an effect is described as being unchangeable "even with a *wish*," that statement supersedes all others here.

*Wishes* can cause great problems if not handled properly. The DM must see that *wishes* are reasonably limited or the balance and enjoyment of the game will be completely upset. The DM should not allow *wishes* that alter the basics of the game (such as a wish that dragons can't breathe for damage). The more unreasonable and greedy the *wish* is, the less likely that the *wish* will become reality.

## Wizardry

Range: 0 (cleric only)

Duration: One turn

Effect: Allows the use of one magic-user device or scroll spell

The cleric using this spell gains the power to use one item normally restricted to magic-users: either a device (such as a wand) or a scroll containing a 1st or 2nd level magic-user spell. (The cleric cannot cast spells of 3rd or higher level, even though they may be present on the scroll.) This ability lasts for one turn, or until the scroll or device is used.

The cleric magically gains knowledge of the proper use of the item, as if the character were a magic-user. For the duration and effect of the magic-user spell, the caster is treated as the minimum level necessary to cast the spell.

![Decorative flourish]()![](_page_40_Picture_1.jpeg)

## Druidic Spells

Druids can learn and cast any spell that a cleric can—with the exception of spells that affect alignments (such as *protection from evil*).

However, druids also have their own spells, spells which clerics and magic-users cannot utilize. The druid cannot cast more spells in a day than a cleric, but he has the advantage of being able to learn spells from two different sources, his own list and the cleric's spell list.

Druidic spells tend to concern nature and the natural order of life rather than combat or power like many of the clerical and magical spells. Druidic spells are also not reversible.

### First Level Druidic Spells

#### Detect Danger

Range: 5' per level of the caster

Duration: One hour

Effect: Reveals hazards

This spell combines some effects of *detect evil* and *find traps*. While it is functioning, the druid can concentrate on places, objects, or creatures within range. He needs a full round of concentration to examine one square foot of area, one creature, or one small object (a chest, weapon, or smaller item). Larger objects require more time.

After he examines the thing, the druid will know whether it is immediately dangerous, potentially dangerous, or benign (all strictly from the druid's point of view). Note that most creatures are potentially dangerous. This spell will detect poisons, while other spells may not.

The duration is a full hour when used in natural outdoor settings on the Prime Plane; elsewhere, the duration is half normal (three turns).

#### Faerie Fire

Range: 60'

Duration: 1 round per level of caster

Effect: Illuminates creatures or objects

With this spell, the druid can outline one or more creatures or objects with a pale, flickering, greenish fire. The fire does not inflict any damage. The objects or creatures need only be detected in some way (such as by sight, or a *detect invisible* spell) to be the object of this spell.

All attacks against the outlined creature or object gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls. The druid can outline one man-sized creature (about 12' of fire) for each 5 levels of experience. Thus, at 20th level, 48' of fire can be produced (outlining one dragon-sized creature, two horse-sized, or four man-sized creatures).

#### Locate

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Detects 1 animal or plant within 120'

This spell allows the druid to sense the direction of one known normal animal or plant. The druid can locate (similar to the *locate object* spell) any normal or giant-sized animal, but not fantastic creatures, plant monsters, nor any intelligent creature or plant.

He must name the exact type of animal or plant, but does not need to see the specific one

he wishes to locate. The animal or plant gets no saving throw. (This spell is most often used to find special rare plants.)

#### Predict Weather

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: 12 hours

Effect: Gives knowledge of coming weather

This spell enables the druid to learn the accurate weather to come for the next 12 hours. It affects an area 1 mile in diameter per level of the druid; for example, a 20th level druid would learn the weather within a 20 mile diameter (a 10 mile radius). The spell does not give the druid any control over the weather; it merely predicts what is to come.

### Second Level Druidic Spells

#### Heat Metal

Range: 30'

Duration: 7 rounds

Effect: Warms one metal object

This spell causes one object to slowly heat and then cool. It will affect one metal item weighing up to one-half pound (5 cn) per level of the caster. A 12th level druid, for example, can heat up to 6 pounds (60 cn—a normal sword, for instance), while a 20th level druid can heat 10 pounds (100 cn—for example, a two-handed sword).

The heat causes no damage to magical items. Normal weapons or other items may be severely damaged, especially if made of both wood and metal (as a normal lance), as the wood will burn away at the point of contact with metal.

If the object is being held when heated, the heat causes damage to the holder: 1 point of damage during the first round, 2 points in the second, 4 points in the third, 8 points in the fourth, and then decreasing at the same rate (for a total of 22 points of heat damage over seven rounds). In the fourth round, the searing heat will cause leather, wood, paper, and other flammable objects in contact with the metal to catch fire.

The holder gets no saving throw, but fire resistance negates all damage. The character can drop the item at any time, of course, and creatures of low intelligence are 80% likely to do so (check each round).

Once the spell has been cast, the druid no longer needs to concentrate; the heating and cooling proceed automatically. A *dispel magic* can stop the effect, but normal means (immersion in water, etc.) will not.

If the spell is used on an item imbedded in an opponent (such as an arrow or dagger), the opponent may remove the item but loses initiative for that round (and takes the appropriate heat damage for that round as well).

Heat damage disrupts concentration; the victim cannot cast spells during any round in which he sustains damage from this spell.

#### Obscure

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Creates a huge misty cloud

This spell causes a misty vapor to arise from the ground around the druid, forming a huge cloud. The cloud is 1' high per level of the druid, and is 10' in diameter for each level. For example, a 20th level druid could cast an *obscure* 20' tall and 200' diameter (100' radius). The cloud has no ill effects except to block vision.

The caster, and all creatures able to see invisible things, will be able to see dimly through the cloud. All other creatures within the cloud will be delayed and confused by the effect. While within the cloud, these creatures are effectively blind.

#### Produce Fire

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: 2 turns per level

Effect: Creates fire in hand

This spell causes a small flame to appear in the druid's hand. It does not harm the caster in any way, and sheds light as if a normal torch. The flame can be used to ignite combustible materials touched to it (a lantern, torch, oil, etc.) without harming the magical flame. While holding the flame, the caster can cause it to disappear and reappear by concentration once per round, until the duration ends. Other items may be held and used in the hand while the fire is out. If desired, the fire may be dropped or thrown to a 30' range, but disappears 1 round after leaving the druid's hand. (Any fire it ignites during that round remains burning.)

#### Warp Wood

Range: 240'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Causes wooden weapons to bend

This spell causes one or more wooden weapons to bend and (probably) become useless. The spell will affect one arrow for each level of the caster; treat a spear, javelin, or magical wand as two arrows' worth, and any club, bow or staff (magical or otherwise) as four. The spell will not affect any wooden items other than weapons. If a magical wooden item (such as an enchanted staff) is the target, the wielder may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. Items carried but not held get no saving throw; magical items with "pluses" might not be affected, at a 10% chance per "plus." (For example, an *arrow +1* would have a 10% chance to be unaffected.)

### Third Level Druidic Spells

#### Call Lightning

Range: 360'

Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Calls lightning bolts from a storm

This spell cannot be used unless a storm of some (any) type is within range of the druid. (This does not mean that he must be within the spell's range of the storm cloud, but only that the stormy weather be taking place within 360' of him.)

If a storm is present, the druid may call 1 lightning bolt per turn (10 minutes) to strike at any point within range. The *lightning bolt* descends from the sky, hitting an area 20' across.

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_41_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_41_Picture_2.jpeg)

Each victim within that area takes 8d6 (8-48) points of electrical damage, but may make a saving throw vs. spells to take half damage. The druid need not call the lightning every turn unless desired; it remains available until the spell duration (or the storm) ends.

## Hold Animal

Range: 180'

Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Paralyzes several animals

This spell will affect any normal or giant-sized animal, but will not affect any fantastic creature, nor one of greater than animal intelligence (2). Each victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or be paralyzed for the duration of the spell.

The druid can affect 1 Hit Die of animals for each level of experience, ignoring "pluses" to Hit Dice. For example, a 20th level druid could cast the spell at 10 giant toads (which have 2 + 2 Hit Dice each). Note that the spell *can* affect summoned, conjured, or controlled animals.

## Protection from Poison

Range: Touch

Duration: One turn per level of the caster

Effect: Gives one creature immunity to all poison

For the duration of this spell, the recipient is completely immune to the effects of poisons of all types, including gas traps and *cloudkill* spells. This protection extends to items carried (thus protecting against a spirit's poisonous presence, for example). Furthermore, the recipient gains a +4 bonus on saving throws vs. poisonous breath weapons (such as green dragon breath), but not petrification breath (such as a gorgon's).

## Water Breathing

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 day

Effect: One air-breathing creature

This spell allows the recipient to breathe while under water (at any depth). It does not affect movement in any way, nor does it interfere with the breathing of air.

## Fourth Level Druidic Spells

### Control Temperature 10' radius

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Cools or warms air within 10'

This spell allows the druid to alter the temperature within an area 20' across. The maximum change is 50 degrees (Fahrenheit), either warmer or cooler. The change occurs immediately, and the effect moves with the druid. The druid may change the temperature simply by concentrating for 1 round, and the temperature will remain changed as long as the spell lasts. The spell is useful for resisting cold or heat so the caster may survive temperature extremes.

### Plant Door

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Opens a path through growth

For the duration of this spell, no plants can prevent the druid's passage, no matter how dense. Even trees will bend or magically open to allow the druid to pass. The druid can freely carry equipment while moving through such barriers, but no other creature can use the passage.

Note that a druid can hide inside a large tree after casting this spell. The druid cannot see what is happening while he is in the tree.

## Protection from Lightning

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Protects against lightning attack

Any recipient of this spell is immune to a given amount of electrical damage. The druid's experience level determines the amount of damage: for each level of experience, one die (1d6) of damage is negated. Subtract the *number of dice* from the *number of dice of damage* that would be done to him.

*Example:* A 20th level druid casts this spell. He is protected against 20d6 lightning damage. For example, this would negate the effects of two full *call lightning* attacks (of 8 dice each) on him, plus half of a third (8 + 8 + 4 = 20). The third *call lightning* inflicts 4d6 points of damage on him (but he does get his saving throw against it), and any subsequent *call lightning* attacks made against him will do full damage.

## Summon Animals

Range: 360'

Duration: 3 turns

Effect: Calls and befriends normal animals

With this spell, the druid can summon any or all normal animals within range. Only normal, nonmagical creatures of animal intelligence are affected, including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, etc. The spell does not affect insects, arthropods, humans, and demihumans. The druid may choose one or more known animals, may call for specific types, or may summon everything within range. The total Hit Dice of the animals responding will equal the level of the druid. Treat normal small creatures (frogs, mice, squirrels, small birds, etc.) as 1/10 Hit Dice each.

Animals affected will come at their fastest movement rate, and will understand the druid's speech while the spell is in effect. They will befriend and help the druid, to the limit of their abilities. If harmed in any way, a summoned animal will normally flee, the spell broken for that animal. However, if the druid is being attacked when a summoned animal arrives, the animal will immediately attack the opponent, fleeing only if it fails a morale check.

This spell may also be used to calm hostile animals encountered while adventuring.

## Fifth Level Druidic Spells

### Anti-Plant Shell

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: 1 round per level of the druid

Effect: Personal barrier which blocks plants

This spell creates an invisible barrier around the druid's body (less than an inch away). The

barrier stops all attacks by plants and plant-like monsters, so that they can inflict no damage. If the caster pushes through normal but dense growth while protected, he will open a path that others can pass through.

While protected, the druid cannot attack plants except by spells; the plants are protected from the druid's physical attacks, just as the druid is protected from theirs.

## Control Winds

Range: 10' radius per level of the caster

Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Calms or increases winds

With this spell, the druid can cause all the air within range to behave as desired, either increasing to gale force or slowing to a dead calm. The druid must concentrate for one full turn of concentration (can't move or attack) to change the wind completely (calm to gale, for example). Any higher-level spellcaster using the same spell can easily counter the spell. The effect moves with the caster.

If the spell is cast against an air creature (such as an elemental), the victim can make a saving throw vs. spells. If the victim fails its roll, the druid can slay or control the air creature by proper use of the wind force. The creature will only obey as long as the druid maintains concentration and while the spell is active; if the druid's concentration is broken or the spell's duration lapses, the creature will attack the druid.

## Dissolve

Range: 240'

Duration: 3-18 days

Effect: Liquefies 3,000 square feet

Nearly identical to the 5th level magic-user spell of the same name, this effect changes a volume of soil or rock (but not a construction) to a morass of mud. An area up to 10' deep or thick is affected, and may have up to 3,000 square feet of surface area. The druid may choose the exact width and length (20' x 150', 30' x 100', etc.), but the entire area of effect must be within 240' of the caster. Creatures moving through the mud are slowed to 10% of their normal movement rate at best, and may become stuck (at the DM's discretion, a victim must make saving throw vs. spells to avoid becoming stuck).

## Pass Plant

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Short-range teleportation

With this spell, the druid can enter one tree, teleport, and immediately step out of another tree of the same type. The trees must be large enough to enclose the druid. The range a druid can teleport varies by the type of tree, as follows.

| Oak                   | 600 yards |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Ash, Elm, Linden, Yew | 360 yards |
| Evergreen trees       | 240 yards |
| Other trees           | 300 yards |

![Decorative flourish]()![](_page_42_Picture_1.jpeg)

## Sixth Level Druidic Spells

### Anti-Animal Shell

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Personal barrier that blocks animals

This spell creates an invisible barrier around the druid's body (less than an inch away). The barrier stops all attacks by animals, both normal and giant-sized, as well as insects and all other nonfantastic creatures of animal intelligence or less (0-2). The druid cannot attack animals while protected except by use of other spells; the animals are protected from the druid's physical attacks, just as the druid is protected from theirs.

### Summon Weather

Range: 5 miles or more

Duration: 6 turns per level

Effect: Brings weather to druid's area

When the druid casts this spell, some known nearby weather condition is pulled to the druid's location. The druid does not have control of the weather, but merely summons it.

Only a druid of 25th level or greater may summon severe weather (hurricane, severe heat wave, etc.). The range of summoning is 5 miles at levels 12 to 15, adding 1 mile for each level of the caster above 15th. (A 20th level druid could summon weather from up to 10 miles away.)

### Transport Through Plants

Range: Infinite

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Long-range teleportation

This spell may be used a maximum of once per day. The druid must be near a plant (of any size), and must choose either a general location or a specific known plant elsewhere. After casting the spell, the druid magically enters the nearby plant and steps out of a plant at the destination (if the druid could not specify the exact plant, he appears from a plant determined randomly by the DM). There is no limit to the range, but the plants must both be living for the spell to work, and must both be on the same plane of existence. If either plant is dead, the spell fails. Otherwise, the caster immediately reappears at the new location. The caster can transport two additional willing creatures.

### Turn Wood

Range: 30'

Duration: One turn per level of the druid

Effect: Pushes all wooden items away

This spell creates an invisible wave of force, 120' long and 60' tall. Its midpoint can be created anywhere within 30' of the caster. This wave of force then immediately moves in one horizontal direction, as specified by the caster, at the rate of 10' per round. If the druid desires, he can stop the wave of force at any time, but cannot thereafter move it again.

All wooden objects contacting or contacted by the wave of force become stuck to it and move with it. The wave of force continues moving until it reaches the maximum range of 360 feet, and stops there for the remainder of the spell du-

ration. The items caught are not harmed by the effect, but wooden weapons (bows, crossbows, most spears and javelins, etc.) and magical items (wands, staves, etc.) cannot be used while trapped in the effect.

Once created, the wave of force does not require concentration. However, the caster may cause it to vanish before the duration ends by concentrating for one round.

This spell has many useful applications during mass combat (against a group of archers or siege engines) and waterborne adventures (to move a ship). It will move wooden objects which have metal attachments (such as treasure chests). However, it will not move permanent constructions (such as buildings, including objects permanently attached to them such as doors) or other secured objects (such as trees).

## Seventh Level Druidic Spells

### Creeping Doom

Range: 120'

Duration: 1 round per level of the caster

Effect: Creates a 20' x 20' insect horde

This spell magically creates a huge swarm of 1,000 creeping insects, appearing anywhere within 120' of the druid (as chosen by the caster). They fill an area at least 20' x 20', and can be ordered to fill any area up to a maximum of 60' x 60'.

The *creeping doom* can move at up to 60'(20') if the caster remains within 120' of any part of the swarm. They vanish after the duration ends, or whenever the druid is more than 120' away.

The insects always attack everyone and everything in their path, inflicting 1 point of damage per 10 insects, a total of 100 points per round to each creature caught in the effect (no saving throw). Normal attacks (such as fire) can damage the horde slightly, but even a *fireball* spell will only slay 100 of them (reducing the damage accordingly). The *creeping doom* can be destroyed by a *dispel magic* spell (at normal chances for success), but it can penetrate a *protection from evil* effect, and can move over most obstacles at the normal movement rate.

### Metal to Wood

Range: 120'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Changes metal into dead wood

This spell can be used to change any metal item or items into wood. The spell can transmute five pounds (50 cn weight) per level of the caster. Any magical metal item is 90% resistant to the magic. The effect is permanent, and the affected metal cannot be changed back with a *dispel magic* spell. Any armor changed to wood falls off the wearer and any weapons affected turn to nonmagical wooden clubs.

### Summon Elemental

Range: 240'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Summons one 16 HD elemental

This spell allows the caster to summon any one elemental per spell (see Chapter 14). The druid may only summon one of each type of elemental

(air, earth, fire, water) in one day. The elemental will understand the druid's spoken commands and will perform any tasks within its power (carrying, attacking, etc.) as directed by the caster.

Unlike the magic-user's version of the spell, the druid does not need to concentrate to control the creature. The caster may send it back to its own plane with a simple command, and someone else may send it back by the use of a *dispel magic* or *dispel evil* spell.

### Weather Control

Range: 0 (druid only)

Duration: Concentration

Effect: All weather within 240 yards

This spell allows the druid to create one special weather condition in the surrounding area (within a 240 yard radius). The caster may select the weather condition. The spell only works outdoors, and the weather will affect all creatures in the area (including the caster). The effects last as long as the caster concentrates, without moving; if the caster is being moved (for example, aboard a ship), the effect moves also. The spell's effects vary, but the following results are typical:

*Rain:* -2 penalty to attack rolls applies to all missile fire. After three turns, the ground becomes muddy, reducing movement to half the normal rate.

*Snow:* Visibility (the distance a creature can see) is reduced to 20'; movement is reduced to half the normal rate. Rivers and streams may freeze over. Mud remains after the snow thaws, for the same movement penalty.

*Fog:* 20' visibility, half normal movement. Those within the fog might become lost, moving in the wrong direction.

*Clear:* This cancels bad weather (rain, snow, fog) but not secondary effects (such as mud).

*Intense Heat:* Movement reduced to half normal. Excess water (from rain, snow, mud transmuted from rock, etc.) dries up.

*High Winds:* No missile fire or flying is possible. Movement reduced to half normal. At sea, ships sailing with the wind move 50% faster. In the desert, high winds create a sandstorm, for half normal movement and 20' visibility.

*Tornado:* This creates a whirlwind under the druid control, attacking and moving as if it was a 12 HD air elemental. At sea, treat the tornado as a storm or gale.

## Magical Spells

### Casting Magical Spells

Spells used by magic-users and elves are somewhat different from those used by clerics and druids, both in their effects and the ways they are learned and used.

### Spell Books

When a magic-user or elf begins play at first level, he starts with a spell book, given to him by his teacher. The spell book will contain two 1st level spells. The Dungeon Master will tell you what spells your character starts with.

The spell book is large and bulky, and cannot be easily carried (about 2' square, 2-6 inches thick, weighing at least 20 pounds). It will not fit inside a normal sack of any size, but may be

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_43_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_43_Picture_2.jpeg)

carried in a backpack or saddlebag. All spell books are written in magical words, and only their owners may read them without using the *read magic spell* (described later).

As previously discussed, the magic-user or elf forgets each spell as he casts it. This is why he has a spell book: He can memorize the spell again later and have it available to him once more.

On the magic-user and elf experience tables, the "Spells/Level" columns indicate how many spells of each level the character can have memorized at one time. This doesn't limit the number of spells the character can have in his spell books.

For example, a fourth level magic-user can memorize four spells—two 1st level and two 2nd level. But his spell book might have more spells written in it. He might have six 1st level spells written in his book, for instance, and he might have three 2nd level spells. He can still only memorize two of each type in a day.

## Learning New Spells

Every magic-user and elf was taught magic by someone else—normally, by a nonplayer character spellcaster of 7th experience level or higher.

Your campaign can assume that magic-user and elf characters have such a teacher, whom they visit and learn from whenever they're not adventuring. The DM may wish to work this NPC into a full-fledged character who can appear in adventures as a consultant or expert.

The PCs' teacher does not go on adventures—not until the characters reach or exceed his experience level, and only then if the DM wishes him to. Otherwise, the player characters would have a very powerful ally along, one who would solve most of their adventuring problems.

When the player character begins play, the teacher gives him a spell book with two 1st level spells in it. When the PC reaches 2nd level, the teacher writes another 1st level spell in the book. When the PC reaches 3rd level, the teacher will write a 2nd level spell in his book, and when he reaches 4th level the teacher will give him one more 2nd level spell.

In many campaigns, that's the point at which the teacher stops instructing the character. The character has gone from apprentice to journeyman, and now he must journey in order to learn more of magic.

So, where can PCs learn more spells? They have several options, and may explore any or all of them during their careers.

Other Magic-Users: By ancient tradition—of necessity and common sense—magic-users are loathe to trade spells among themselves. Each magic-user knows that he may become a very powerful wizard some day . . . and that he may end up being the enemy of another wizard of similar power. No wizard wants to teach the other fellow magic that can kill him. This is something the DM should reinforce in his campaign: If he finds characters casually trading spells from their spell books, he should remind them of the traditions of secrecy, of the good reasons for that tradition, of the paranoia that infects the magic-users' community, and so on. If they decline to accept his recommendation, their characters may pick up a reputation—as magic-users who can't keep their trade secret. Other spellcasters, perhaps even their old teachers, will refuse to teach them and will take special pains to keep their

magic hidden from them. Higher-level magic-users may even decide to steal or destroy the PCs' spell books to teach them a lesson—forcing them to work for many boring weeks or months to reconstruct them (see "Lost Spell Books," below).

But that's *casual* exchanges of spells. It's known for magic-users to give spells to PCs in more remarkable circumstances. For instance, low-level spellcasters might do a great favor for a high-level magician (save his child, undertake a special quest for him and demonstrate remarkable bravery while carrying it out, etc.). In such a case, it is not necessarily inappropriate for the NPC to reward the PC with a spell.

The Teacher: Once the player character reaches 4th experience level, his teacher doesn't have to leave play entirely. The PC might be able to visit and train with him from time to time, and the teacher could continue to teach him spells. But since the PC is a journeyman now, the teacher might also require him to undertake specific tasks ("Now, I need you to take this flask to Esdevius in far-off Parokaland . . . and don't let the dragon get you.") in order to remain his student. While the PC could continue learning spells this way, the teacher should not be his only source for new spells; he should be learning others as he adventures.

Scrolls: One magical treasure sometimes found in adventures is the magical scroll. Some scrolls have magic-user spells written upon them. A magic-user can use the scroll by casting the spell from it—in which case the written spell disappears as soon as it is cast. Or, he can transfer it to his spell book (during this process, the spell disappears from the scroll), and he will have gained a new spell.

Enemy Magic-Users: Should the PCs encounter and defeat an enemy magic-user, the PC magic-user might try to help himself to the enemy's spell book. The DM should make sure that the spell book has many spells which are identical to those in the PC's spell book: Most magic-users have many spells in common, especially the lower-level spells. The PC should gain only one or two new spells out of such an encounter. A new spell is a rare find, and a spell book is an even rarer treasure; the books are always well hidden and protected. PCs using someone else's spell book may find magical traps and curses within before they find any new spells.

## Higher-level Spells

A magic-user cannot put into his spell book a spell of a higher-level than he can cast. In other words, if he can't yet cast a 3rd level spell, he certainly can't write one in his spell book.

## Lost Spell Books

A magic-user or elf whose spell book is lost or destroyed cannot regain spells until he replaces the spell book. He can't just read from somebody else's spell book. He can recreate the spells from memory and research . . . but it takes a lot of money and a lot of time.

The method, amount of time, and cost it takes to recreate a spell book are for the DM to decide. Here's a rough guideline: 1,000 gold pieces and one week of study for each spell level replaced. (For example, each 3rd level spell would require 3,000 gp and three weeks to reconstruct). This reconstruction takes up all the

character's time, leaving none for adventuring.

A character can make a second spell book to leave in a safe place in case his primary book is destroyed. This doesn't take all the time and money which reconstruction of spells requires; a magic-user or elf could copy four spells a day from his primary spell book to his "backup."

## The Player Character's Spell Book

Both the player and the DM need to keep track of exactly which spells are in a character's spell book. Both people can keep track of which spells the character has had access to; the player can keep track of the ones the character acquires. If ever there's a difference in the two spell lists, the player should be able to remember where the character acquired the extra spells; if the explanation doesn't satisfy the DM, he's may remove the spell from the character's spell book. Appendix 3 provides a copyable spell book sheet, on which players can keep the name and description of all their characters' spells.

## Reversible Spells

Unlike clerical spells, magical spells must be memorized in their reversed form to be usable in that form. The spellcaster must select the normal or reversed form of the spell when he memorizes the spell for the day. There's no problem to memorizing a spell in reversed form; if the spell can be reversed, the magic-user knows how to memorize it that way.

Of course, a magic-user could memorize it once in normal form and once in reversed form. For example, if a spellcaster has a *light* spell in a spell book, the character could memorize both *light* and *darkness* for an adventure.

In the spell lists below, all spells which can be reversed are marked with an asterisk (\*).

## First Level Magical Spells

### Analyze

Range: 0 (touch only)

Duration: 1 round

Effect: Analyzes magic on one item

A spellcaster using this spell can handle one item and learn the enchantment on it. Helms must be put on the spellcaster's head, swords held in his hand, bracelets put on his wrist, etc. for this spell to work. Any consequences of this action (for example, from *curse* or booby-trapped objects) fall upon the spellcaster, though he gets his usual saving throws.

The spellcaster has a chance of 15% plus 5% per experience level to determine one magical characteristic of the item; if the item is non-magical, his chance is to determine that fact.

The spell does not reveal much precise information. It will characterize a weapon's pluses (attack bonus as "many" or "few," will estimate the number of charges on an item within 25% of the actual number, etc.

### Charm Person

Range: 120'

Duration: See below

Effect: One living person (see below)

This spell will only affect humans, demi-humans, and certain other creatures. The victim

![Decorative border image]()![](_page_44_Picture_0.jpeg)

## Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border image]()![](_page_44_Picture_2.jpeg)

is allowed a saving throw vs. spells. If the saving throw is successful, the spell has no effect. If it fails, the victim will believe that the spellcaster is its "best friend," and will try to defend the spellcaster against any threat, whether real or imagined. The victim is *charmed*.

As a general rule, the spell only affects creatures which look similar to humans in various ways—humans, demihumans, certain giant-class creatures, etc. It will not affect animals, magical creatures (such as living statues), undead monsters, or human-like creatures larger than ogres.

If the spellcaster can speak a language that the charmed victim understands, the spellcaster may give orders to the victim. These orders should sound like suggestions, as if "just between friends." The *charmed* victim will usually obey, but the victim may resist orders that are contrary to the victim's nature (alignment and habits)—he doesn't need to roll anything to resist. A victim will refuse to obey if ordered to kill itself.

A *charm* may last for months. The victim may make another saving throw every so often, depending on its Intelligence score.

### Charm Person Duration

| If the Victim Has:           | He Saves Every: |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| High Intelligence (13-18):   | 1 day           |
| Average Intelligence (9-12): | 1 week          |
| Low Intelligence (3-8):      | 1 month         |

A more complex system for determining the duration of a *charm* spell appears in Chapter 13, on page 144.

A victim who is given conflicting orders and impressions by his old adventuring friends and his new "best friend" should react as any person would in real life: with confusion. He will not automatically assume that one party or the other is lying . . . even if the player wants him to.

The *charm* is automatically broken if the spellcaster attacks the victim, whether by spell or by weapon. The victim will fight normally if attacked by the spellcaster's allies.

### Detect Magic

| Range: 0                      |
|-------------------------------|
| Duration: 2 turns             |
| Effect: Everything within 60' |

When he casts this spell, the spellcaster will see a glow surround all magical objects, creatures, and places which are visible and within range of the spell. No saving throw is allowed.

*Example:* Shortly after casting this spell, a magic-user walks into a room containing a door locked by magic, a magical potion lying nearby, and a treasure chest containing a magical wand. All the magic will glow, but the spellcaster can see only the door and potion; the light of the glowing wand is hidden by the treasure chest.

### Floating Disc

| Range: 0                       |
|--------------------------------|
| Duration: 6 turns              |
| Effect: Disc remains within 6' |

This spell creates an invisible magical horizontal platform about the size and shape of a small round shield. It can carry up to 5000 cn (500 pounds). It cannot be created in a place occupied

by a creature or object. The *floating disc* is created at the height of the spellcaster's waist, and will always remain at that height. It will automatically follow the spellcaster at his current movement rate, remaining within 6' of him at all times. It can never be used as a weapon, because it has no solid existence and veers away from anything it might run into. When the duration ends, the *floating disc* will disappear, suddenly dropping anything upon it. No saving throw is allowed.

### Hold Portal

| Range: 10'                                |
|-------------------------------------------|
| Duration: 2-12 (2d6) turns                |
| Effect: One door, gate, or similar portal |

This spell will magically hold shut any portal—for example, a door or gate. A *knock* spell will open the *hold portal*. Any creature three or more Hit Dice greater than the caster (and characters three or more levels higher) may break open a held portal in one round, but the portal will relock if allowed to close within the duration of the spell.

*Example:* Any 5th level character can break through a *hold portal* spell cast by a 2nd level spellcaster.

### Light\*

| Range: 120'                                    |
|------------------------------------------------|
| Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/level of the caster |
| Effect: Volume of 30' diameter                 |

This spell creates a large ball of light, much like a bright torchlight. If the spell is cast on an object (such as a coin), the *light* will move with the object. If cast at a creature's eyes, the creature must make a saving throw vs. spells. If he fails the saving throw, the victim will be blinded by the *light* until the duration ends (see page 150, for the effects of blindness). If he makes the saving throw, the *light* appears in the air behind the intended victim.

When reversed, this spell, *darkness*, creates a circle of darkness 30' in diameter. It will block all sight except infravision. *Darkness* will cancel a *light* spell if cast upon it (but may itself be canceled by another *light* spell). If cast at an opponent's eyes, it will cause blindness until canceled, or until the duration ends; as before, the victim does get a saving throw.

### Magic Missile

| Range: 150'                      |
|----------------------------------|
| Duration: 1 round                |
| Effect: Creates 1 or more arrows |

A *magic missile* is a glowing arrow, created and shot by magic, which inflicts  $1d6 + 1$  (2-7) points of damage to any creature it strikes. After the spell is cast, the arrow appears next to the spellcaster and hovers there (moving with him) until the spellcaster causes it to shoot. When shot, the *magic missile* will automatically hit any one visible target the spellcaster specifies. The *magic missile* actually has no solid form, and cannot be touched. A *magic missile* never misses its target and the target is *not* allowed a saving throw.

For every 5 levels of experience of the caster, two more missiles are created by the same spell.

Thus a 6th level spellcaster may create three missiles. The spellcaster may shoot the missiles all at one target or at different targets.

### Protection from Evil

| Range: 0                     |
|------------------------------|
| Duration: 6 turns            |
| Effect: The spellcaster only |

This spell creates an invisible magical barrier all around the spellcaster's body (less than an inch away). All attacks against the spellcaster are penalized by —1 to their attack rolls, and the spellcaster gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws, while the spell lasts.

In addition, enchanted creatures cannot attack the spellcaster in hand-to-hand or melee combat. (An enchanted creature is one that normal weapons cannot hurt; only magical weapons can hit the creature. A creature that can be only hit by a silver weapon—a werewolf, for example—is not an enchanted creature. Any creature that is magically summoned or controlled, such as a *charmed* character, is also considered to be an enchanted creature.)

The barrier thus completely prevents all attacks from those creatures unless they use missile weapons; the barrier is no defense against missiles, though the attackers still suffer the —1 attack roll penalties.

This spell will not affect a *magic missile*, either incoming or outgoing. If the spellcaster attacks (hand-to-hand) anything during the spell's duration, the effect changes slightly. Enchanted creatures are then able to touch the spellcaster, but the attack roll and saving throw adjustments still apply until the spell duration ends.

### Read Languages

| Range: 0                     |
|------------------------------|
| Duration: 2 turns            |
| Effect: The spellcaster only |

This spell will allow the spellcaster to read, *not* speak, any unknown languages or codes, including treasure maps, secret symbols, and so forth, until the duration ends.

### Read Magic

| Range: 0                     |
|------------------------------|
| Duration: 1 turn             |
| Effect: The spellcaster only |

This spell will allow the spellcaster to read, not speak, any magical words or runes, such as those found on scrolls and other items. A spellcaster cannot understand unfamiliar magic writings without using this spell. However, once a spellcaster reads a scroll or runes with this spell, he can read or speak that magic later *without* using a spell.

All spell books are written in magical words, and only their owners may read them without using this spell.

### Shield

| Range: 0                     |
|------------------------------|
| Duration: 2 turns            |
| Effect: The spellcaster only |

This spell creates a magical barrier all around the spellcaster (less than an inch away). It moves

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border image]()![](_page_45_Picture_1.jpeg)

with the spellcaster. While the duration lasts, the spellcaster has an AC of 2 against missiles, and AC 4 against all other attacks.

If someone shoots a *magic missile* at a spellcaster protected by this spell, the spellcaster may make a saving throw vs. spells (one saving throw per missile). If the saving throw is successful, the *magic missile* has no effect; it hits the barrier and evaporates.

### Sleep

Range: 240'

Duration: 4d4 (4-16) turns

Effect: 2-16 Hit Dice of living creatures within a 40' square area

This spell will put creatures to sleep for up to 16 turns. It will only affect creatures with 4 + 1 Hit Dice or less—generally, small or man-sized creatures. The spell will not affect creatures outside the 40' X 40' area which the player chooses as the spell's target area. The spell will not work against undead or very large creatures, such as dragons.

When a character is first hit with a *sleep* spell, falling or sagging to the ground will not wake him up. However, characters affected by a *sleep* spell are not in a deep sleep. Any sleeping character or creature will awaken if slapped, kicked, or shaken.

Characters can kill a sleeping victim with a single blow of any edged weapon, regardless of the creature's hit points.

Your Dungeon Master will roll 2d8 to find the total Hit Dice or experience levels of monsters affected by the spell.

The victims get *no* saving throw against this spell.

### Ventriloquism

Range: 60'

Duration: 2 turns

Effect: One item or location

This spell will allow the spellcaster to make the sound of his or her voice come from somewhere else, such as a statue, animal, a dark corner, and so forth. The "somewhere else" must be within range of the spell.

## Second Level Magical Spells

### Continual Light\*

Range: 120'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Volume of 60' diameter

This spell creates a globe of light 60' across. It is much brighter than a torch, but not as bright as full daylight. It will continue to glow forever, or until it is magically removed. It may be cast on an object, just as the first level *light* spell. If cast at a creature's eyes, the victim must make a saving throw vs. spells. If he fails the saving throw, the victim is blinded—permanently, or until the spell is dispelled. If he makes the saving throw, the globe will still appear, but will remain in the place it was cast, and the intended victim will suffer no ill effects.

The reverse of this spell, *continual darkness*, creates a volume of complete darkness in a 30' radius. Torches, lanterns, and even a *light* spell

will not affect it, and infravision cannot penetrate it. If cast on a creature's eyes, the creature must make a saving throw vs. spells or be blinded until the spell is removed. A *continual light* spell will cancel its effects.

### Detect Evil

Range: 60'

Duration: 2 turns

Effect: Everything within 60'

When this spell is cast, the spellcaster will see a glow surround all evil-enchanted objects within 60'. It will also cause creatures that want to harm the spellcaster to glow when they are within range. The spell, however, does not allow the spellcaster to hear the actual thoughts of the creatures.

Remember that Chaotic alignment is not automatically the same as evil, although many Chaotic monsters have evil intentions. Traps and poison are neither good nor evil, but merely dangerous.

### Detect Invisible

Range: 10' per level of the spellcaster

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: The spellcaster only

When this spell is cast, the spellcaster can see all invisible creatures and objects within range. The range is 10' for each level of the spellcaster. For example, a 3rd level spellcaster can use this spell to see invisible things within 30'.

### Entangle

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 round per level

Effect: Controls ropes

This spell allows the spellcaster to use any rope-like object of living or once-living material (roots, vines, leather ropes, plant-fibre ropes, etc.) to behave as he or she orders. About 50' of normal 1/2" diameter vine plus 5' per level of the caster can be affected.

The commands which can be given during an *entangle* spell include: *coil* (form a neat stack), *coil and knot*, *loop*, *loop and knot*, *tie* and *knot*, and the reverses of all the above. The vine or rope must be within 1' of any object it is to coil around or tie up, so it must often be thrown at the target. This spell is very useful in climbing situations; a spellcaster can toss a rope up the side of a wall or cliff and command it to *loop and knot* itself around a projection at the height of the throw. *Coil and knot* effectively ties up a victim.

A person or monster attacked by any use of the spell may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effects of the *entangle*.

### ESP\*

Range: 60'

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: All thoughts in one direction

This spell will allow the spellcaster to "hear" thoughts. The spellcaster must concentrate in one direction for six rounds (one minute) to hear the thoughts (if any) of a creature within range. The spell allows the spellcaster to understand the

thoughts of any single living creature, regardless of the language. The spell does not allow the caster to hear the thoughts of undead creatures.

If more than one creature is within range and in the direction the caster is concentrating, the spellcaster will "hear" a confused jumble of thoughts. The spellcaster can sort out the jumble only by concentrating for an extra six rounds to find a single creature.

*ESP* will not be hampered by any amount of wood or liquid, and will penetrate as much as two feet of rock, but a thin coating of lead will block the spell. Targets can make a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the spell effects.

The reverse of this spell, *mindmask*, may be cast, by touch, on any one creature. The recipient is completely immune to *ESP* and all other forms of mind-reading for the spell duration.

### Invisibility

Range: 240'

Duration: Permanent until broken

Effect: One creature or object

This spell will make any one creature or object invisible. When a creature becomes invisible, all items that he carries and wears also become invisible. Any invisible item becomes visible again when it leaves the creature's possession (dropped, set down, etc.). A light source (such as a torch) may be made invisible, but the light given off will always remain visible.

If the spellcaster makes an object invisible that is not being carried or worn, it will become visible again when touched by any living creature. An invisible creature will remain invisible until he or she attacks or casts any spell.

### Knock

Range: 60'

Duration: See below

Effect: One lock or bar

This spell will open any type of lock. This spell will open any normal or magically locked door (one affected by a *hold portal* or *wizard lock* spell), and any secret door (but a secret door must be found before it can be *knocked open*). Any locking magic will remain, however, and will take effect once again when the door is closed. This spell will also unlock a gate, or unstick it if it is stuck, and will cause any treasure chest to open easily. It will also cause a barred door to open, magically forcing the bar to fall to the floor. If a door is locked and barred, only one type of lock will be opened.

### Levitate

Range: 0

Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/level of the caster

Effect: The spellcaster only

When this spell is cast, the spellcaster may move up or down in the air without any support. This spell does *not*, however, allow the spellcaster to move from side to side. For example, a spellcaster could levitate to a ceiling, and then could slowly move sideways by pushing and pulling. His movement up or down is at the rate of 20' per round.

The spell cannot be cast on another person or object. The spellcaster may carry a normal

## Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

amount of weight while levitating, up to 2,000 cn (200 lbs) in weight, possibly another mass-sized creature (if it isn't wearing metal armor). Any creature smaller than man-sized can be carried, unless heavily laden. No saving throw is allowed.

### Locate Object

Range:  $60' + 10'$  per level of the spellcaster

Duration: 2 turns

Effect: One object within range

The spellcaster casts this spell to find an object within the spell's range. For this spell to work, the spellcaster must know exactly what the object looks like. He can specify a common type of object, such as "any flight of stairs," instead.

The spell will point to the nearest designated object within range, giving the direction but *not* the distance.

The spell's range increases as the spellcaster gains levels of experience. For example, a 2nd level spellcaster can locate objects up to 80' away; a 3rd level spellcaster, up to 90'.

### Mirror Image

Range: 0

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: The spellcaster only

With this spell, the spellcaster creates 1d4 (1-4) additional images which look and act exactly like him. The images appear and remain next to (within 3') of the spellcaster, moving if the spell-

caster moves, talking if the spellcaster talks, and so forth. The spellcaster need not concentrate; the images will remain until the duration ends, or until they are hit.

The images are not real, and cannot actually do anything. Any successful attack on the spellcaster will strike an image instead, which will merely cause that image to disappear (regardless of the actual damage); this continues until all the images are dispelled. (If the spellcaster is caught in the effect of an area-type attack, such as a *fireball* spell, all images will disappear and the spellcaster will be affected by the spell.)

### Phantasmal Force

Range: 240'

Duration: Concentration (see below)

Effect: A volume  $20' \times 20' \times 20'$ 

This spell creates or changes appearances of everything within the area affected. The spellcaster can create the illusion of something he or she has seen. If not, the DM will give a bonus to the saving throws of those trying to ignore the spell's effects. If the spellcaster does not use this spell to attack, the illusion created by this spell will disappear when touched.

If the spellcaster uses the spell to create the illusion of a monster, it will appear in every way to be the monster in question. However, the monster is AC 9 and will disappear when hit.

If the spellcaster uses the spell to create an attack (a phantasmal *magic missile*, collapsing wall, etc.), the victim may make a saving throw

vs. spells; if he is successful, the victim is not affected, and realizes that the attack is an illusion.

The phantasmal force will remain as long as the spellcaster concentrates. If the spellcaster moves, takes any damage, or fails any saving throw, his concentration is broken and the phantasm disappears.

This spell *never* inflicts any real damage. Those "killed" by it will merely fall unconscious, those "turned to stone" will be paralyzed, and so forth. The effects wear off in 1d4 turns. If the character does make his saving throw to realize that the attack is an illusion, the damage sustained disappears immediately.

### Web

Range: 10'

Duration: 48 turns

Effect: A volume  $10' \times 10' \times 10'$ 

This spell creates a mass of sticky strands which are difficult to destroy except with flame. It usually blocks the area affected. Giants and other creatures with great strength can break through a web in 2 rounds. A human of Average Strength (a score of 9-12) will take 2d4 (2-8) turns to break through the web. Flames (from a torch, for example) will destroy the web in 2 rounds, but all creatures within the web will be burned for 1-6 (1d6) points of damage. Anyone wearing *gauntlets of ogre power* (a magical treasure) can break free of a web in 4 rounds.

## Wizard Lock

Range: 10'  
Duration: Permanent  
Effect: One portal or lock

This spell is a more powerful version of a *hold portal* spell. It will work on any lock, not merely doors, and will last forever (or until magically dispelled). However, a *knock* spell can open the *wizard lock*.

The wizard who cast the *wizard lock* can easily open the door he has enchanted, as can any magic-using character or creature of three or more levels (or Hit Dice) greater than the caster. This sort of door-opening does not remove the magic, and the magical lock will relock when allowed to close (just as with the *hold portal* spell).

## Third Level Magical Spells

### Clairvoyance

Range: 60'  
Duration: 12 turns

Effect: See through another's eyes

With this spell, the caster may see through the eyes of any single creature in spell range.

"Seeing" through a creature's eyes takes one full turn, after which the caster can change to another creature, even one in another direction; he does not have to cast the spell again to do so. Two feet of rock or a thin coating of lead blocks the effects of this spell. No saving throw is allowed.

### Create Air

Range: Immediate area, 8,000 cu. ft.  
Duration: 1 hour per level of caster  
Effect: Provides breathable air

This spell provides breathable air, especially in areas where otherwise there is none to be had. It is cast on a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (such as a 20' x 20' x 20' room) and, while it is in effect, everyone in that area has good air to breathe.

Customarily, it's used when dungeon explorers are trapped where air is running out. When cast in this fashion, the spell effect stays in one place; it does not move with the caster.

However, it does not have to be cast in only that way; it can be cast on enclosed vehicle interiors (such as the below-deck areas of ships), living creatures, or pieces of equipment. When it is so cast, it will provide pressurized air for the duration of the spell effect, and the spell will travel with the vehicle on which it is cast.

The spell may be cast upon one person, whereupon he can breathe normally. It's not the same as water *breathing*, though—if he dives underwater, he can still breathe, but great quantities of air are always bubbling up from him, making stealthy travel an impossibility.

The spell may be cast upon a specific piece of equipment like a helmet, and whichever one person wears it may breathe normally. If the helmet is not fully enclosed (i.e., airtight), air will leak out from it under pressure; underwater this makes stealthy movement impossible.

A flying creature on which this spell is cast can not only breathe in hostile environments, it can fly through airless void. This means that a pegasus-ride could cast one spell on himself and one on his pegasus, and then the two of them

could fly into the ether of outer space.

The spell does not protect people from the effects of poison gasses unless the gas in question is a normal component of the atmosphere.

### Dispel Magic

Range: 120'  
Duration: Permanent  
Effect: Destroys spells in a 20' cube

This spell destroys other spell effects in a cubic volume of 20' x 20' x 20'. It does not affect magical items. Spell effects created by a caster (whether cleric, druid, magic-user, or elf) of a level equal to or lower than the spellcaster of the *dispel magic* are automatically and immediately destroyed. Spell effects created by a higher-level spellcaster might not be affected. The chance of failure is 5% per level of difference between the spellcasters. For example, a 7th level magic-user trying to dispel a *web* spell cast by a 9th level cleric would have a 10% chance of failure.

*Dispel magic* will not affect a magical item (such as a scroll, a magical sword, etc.). However, it can dispel the effects of the magical item when that item is used (a spellcaster can cast *dispel magic* on the victim of a *ring of human control* and snap him out of that control).

### Fireball

Range: 240'  
Duration: Instantaneous  
Effect: Explosion in a sphere 40' diameter

This spell creates a missile of fire that bursts into a ball of fire with a 40' diameter (20' radius) where it strikes a target. The *fireball* will cause 1d6 points of fire damage per level of the caster to every creature in the area of effect.

Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells; if successful, the spell will only do half damage. For example, a *fireball* cast by a 6th level spellcaster will burst for 6d6 (6-36) points of damage; characters who make their saving throw vs. spell will take only half of the damage rolled on the dice.

### Fly

Range: Touch  
Duration: 1d6 (1-6) turns + 1 turn per level of the caster  
Effect: One creature may fly

This spell allows the target it is cast upon (possibly the spellcaster himself) to fly. The recipient can fly in any direction and at any speed up to 360' (120') by mere concentration. The recipient may also stop and hover at any point (as a *levitate* spell); this does not require concentration.

### Haste\*

Range: 240'  
Duration: 3 turns  
Effect: Up to 24 creatures move double speed

This spell allows up to 24 creatures in a 60' diameter circle to perform actions at double speed for half an hour (3 turns). Those affected may move at up to twice normal speed and make double the normal number of missile or hand-to-hand attacks.

This spell does not affect the rate at which

magic works, so a *hasted* spellcaster can still not cast more than one spell per round, and the use of magical devices (such as wands) cannot be speeded up.

The reverse of this spell, slow, will remove the effects of a *haste* spell, or will cause the victims to move and attack at half normal speed.

As with *haste*, the slow spell does not affect spellcasting or the use of magical devices.

The victims may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect.

### Hold Person\*

Range: 120'  
Duration: 1 turn/level  
Effect: Paralyzes up to 4 creatures

The *hold person* spell will affect any human, demihuman, or human-like creature (bugbear, dryad, gnoll, hobgoblin, kobold, lizard man, ogre, orc, nixie, pixie or sprite, for instance). It will not affect the undead or creatures larger than ogres.

Each victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or be paralyzed for nine turns. The spell may be cast at a single person or at a group. If cast at a single person, the victim suffers a —2 penalty to the saving throw. If cast at a group, it will affect up to four persons (of the cleric's choice), but with no penalty to their rolls. The paralysis may only be removed by the reversed form of the spell, or by a *dispel magic* spell.

The reverse of the spell, *free person*, removes the paralysis of up to four victims of the normal form of the spell (including *hold person* cast by a cleric). It has no other effect; e.g., it does not remove the effects of a ghoul's paralysis ability.

### Infravision

Range: Touch  
Duration: 1 day  
Effect: One living creature

This spell enables the recipient to see in the dark, to a 60' range, with the same sort of vision possessed by dwarves and elves.

Infravision is the ability to see heat (and the lack of heat). Dwarves, elves, and casters of the *infravision* spell have infravision in addition to normal sight and can see 60' in the dark. Infravision does not work in normal and magical light. Fire and other heat sources can interfere with infravision, just as a bright flash of light can make normal vision go black for a short time.

With infravision, warm things appear red, and cold things appear blue. For example, an approaching creature could be seen as a red shape, leaving faint reddish footprints. A cold pool of water would seem a deep blue color.

Characters with infravision can even see items or creatures which are the same temperature as the surrounding air (such as a table or a skeleton), since air flow will inevitably show the viewer their borders, outlining them in a faint lighter-blue tone. Until they move, they will be very faint to the eye; once they start moving, they become blurry but very obvious light-blue figures.

Infravision isn't good enough to read by. A character can use his infravision to recognize an individual only if they are within 10' distance unless the individual is very, very distinctive (for example, 8' tall or walking with a crutch).

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative header image]()![](_page_48_Picture_2.jpeg)

## Invisibility 10' radius

Range: 120'

Duration: Permanent until broken

Effect: All creatures within 10'

This spell makes the recipient (and all others within 10' at the time of the casting) invisible. This is an area effect, and those who move further than 10' from the recipient become visible. They may not regain *invisibility* by returning to the area. Otherwise, the invisibility is the same as that bestowed by the spell *invisibility*. An invisible creature will remain invisible until he or she attacks or casts any spell.

All items carried (whether by the recipient or others within 10') also become invisible.

## Lightning Bolt

Range: 180'

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Bolt 60' long, 5' wide

This spell creates a bolt of lightning, starting up to 180' away from the caster and extending 60' in a straight line further away. All creatures within the area of effect take 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster. (Thus a 6th level elf would cast a *lightning bolt* doing 6d6 points of damage.)

Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells; if successful, he takes only half damage.

If the *lightning bolt* strikes a solid surface (such as a wall), it will bounce back toward the caster until the total length of the bolt is 60'.

## Protection from Evil 10' Radius

Range: 0

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: Barrier 20' diameter

This spell creates an invisible magical barrier all around the caster, extending for a 10' radius in all directions. The spell serves as protection from attacks by monsters of an alignment other than the caster's. Each creature within the barrier gains a +1 to all saving throws, and all attacks against those within are penalized by -1 to the attacker's attack roll while the spell lasts.

In addition, enchanted creatures cannot attack those within the barrier in hand-to-hand (meele) combat. (An enchanted creature is any creature which is magically summoned or controlled, such as a *charmed* character, or one that is not harmed by normal weapons. A creature that can be hit only by a silver weapon—a werewolf, for example—is not an enchanted creature.)

If anyone within the barrier attacks an enchanted creature, the barrier will no longer prevent the creature from attacking hand-to-hand, but the bonus to saving throws and penalty to attack rolls will still apply.

Attackers, including enchanted creatures, can attack people inside the barrier by using missile or magical attacks. They do suffer the —1 penalty to attack rolls, but that is the only penalty they suffer.

## Protection from Normal Missiles

Range: 30'

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: One creature

This spell gives the recipient complete protection from all small nonmagical missiles (such as arrows, quarrels, thrown spears, etc.); the ranged attacks simply miss. Large or magical attacks, such as a catapult stone or a magic arrow, are not affected.

The spellcaster can cast the spell on any one creature within the spell's range.

## Water Breathing

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 day (24 hours)

Effect: One air-breathing creature

This spell allows the recipient to breathe while underwater (at any depth). It does not affect his movement in any way, nor does it interfere with the breathing of air if the recipient emerges from the water.

## Fourth Level Magical Spells

### Charm Monster

Range: 120'

Duration: Special

Effect: One or more living creatures

This spell effect is identical to that of a *charm person* spell, but will affect any creature except an undead monster. If cast on victims with 3 Hit Dice or less, the spell will *charm* 3d6 (3-18) victims. Otherwise, it will *charm* only one victim.

Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effects.

### Clothform

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates up to 30' x 30' cloth

This spell creates quantities of cloth up to 30'x30'. The cloth created by a single spell must appear in one piece. Unlike many creation-type spells, this one creates cloth that is non-magical and cannot be dispelled.

If the campaign uses the optional general skills and the caster has an appropriate Craft skill, he may shape the cloth as he creates it. He may thus create a tent, a sail, a single garment, a drape, 60' of common rope, etc. If the campaign doesn't use the skills rules, the character could have been defined earlier as one who knows how to work cloth in order for him to do this. Naturally, unshaped cloth created by this spell can later be cut, sewn and otherwise fashioned into such objects.

The cloth so created is much like undyed linen—it's tough, serviceable, and unglamorous. A caster can create his cloth with an unfinished end, and later he or another caster can use another *clothform* to create cloth joined to the first on that edge—and there will be no seam or weakness at the joining. This makes it a good spell for creating rugged, dependable sails.

When created, the cloth extrudes from the caster's hands and out along the ground. If there are obstacles, it piles up against them but does not shove them back. The spell may not be cast to create a huge sheet which falls over a unit of enemies, for instance. The cloth, when created, may not be attached to anything except to another expanse of *clothform* cloth, as described

above. The cloth cannot be cast in a space occupied by another object.

In adventures, this spell is often used to make quick shelters and to create rope.

## Confusion

Range: 120'

Duration: 12 rounds

Effect: 3-18 creatures in an area 60' across

This spell will confuse its victims, affecting all creatures within a 30' radius. Victims with less than 2 + 1 Hit Dice are not allowed a saving throw. Those with 2 + 1 or more Hit Dice must make a saving throw vs. spells every round of the spell's duration, if they remain in the area, or be confused.

Confused creatures act randomly. The DM should roll 2d6 each round to determine each creature's action, using the following chart:

### Confusion Results

#### 2d6 Roll Result

| 2-5  | Attack the spellcaster's party  |
|------|---------------------------------|
| 6-8  | Do nothing                      |
| 9-12 | Attack the creature's own party |

## Dimension Door

Range: 10'

Duration: 1 round

Effect: Safely transport one creature

This spell will transport one creature (either the caster or a victim up to 10' from the caster) to a place up to 360' away. The caster picks the desired destination. If he does not know the location, the caster may specify the direction and distance of travel, but the distance cannot exceed a total of 360' (for example, 360' straight up; or 200' west, 60' south, and 100' down).

If this would cause the recipient to arrive at a location occupied by a solid object, the spell has no effect.

An unwilling recipient may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect.

## Growth of Plants\*

Range: 120'

Duration: Special

Effect: Enlarges 3000 square feet of plants

This spell causes normal brush or woods to become thickly overgrown with vines, creepers, thorns, and briars (or types of small plant-life appropriate to the area). The spell affects an area of up to 3,000 square feet (the caster chooses the dimensions of the spell effect). The plants to be affected must be entirely within the spell's range.

The area affected by the spell is impassable to all but giant-sized creatures. The effect lasts until removed by the reversed form of the spell or by a *dispel magic* spell.

The reverse of this spell, *shrink plants*, causes all normal plants within the area of effect to shrink and become passable. It may be used to negate the effects of the normal spell. *Shrink plants* will not affect plant-like monsters (such as treants).

## Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative floral border.]()![](_page_49_Picture_1.jpeg)

![Illustration of a spellcaster casting a spell, possibly a wall of ice, while a creature is being affected.]()![](_page_49_Picture_2.jpeg)

each. The illusion will hide the recipients from creatures moving through the area affected.

The spell lasts until a *dispel magic* is cast on it or until the caster decides to drop the illusion. The appearance of each disguised creature returns to normal if the creature moves out of the affected area. However, movement within the area does not destroy the illusion.

### Polymorph Other

Range: 60'

Duration: Permanent until dispelled

Effect: Changes one living creature

This spell changes the victim into another living creature. The new form may have no more than twice as many Hit Dice as the original, or the spell will fail. The victim's hit points remain the same; an 8th level prince with 32 hit points could end up as a frog with 32 hit points.

Unlike the *polymorph self* spell, the *polymorph others* spell actually turns the victim into the new creature, giving him any and all special abilities of the new form, plus its tendencies and behavior. For example, a hobgoblin polymorphed into a mule will think and act like a mule.

This spell cannot create a duplicate of a specific individual, only a race or monster type. For example, a creature polymorphed into a 9th level fighter will indeed become a human, but not necessarily a fighter and no higher than 1st level.

The victim of this spell may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. The effect lasts until dispelled, or until the creature dies.

### Hallucinatory Terrain

Range: 240'

Duration: Special

Effect: Changes or hides terrain in 240' radius (or less)

This spell creates the illusion of a terrain feature, either indoors (such as a pit, stairs, etc.) or outdoors (hill, swamp, grove of trees, etc.), possibly hiding a real feature. The caster could create the illusion of solid ground over a series of pits or quicksand pools, or he could create the image of dense forest over his army's camp, etc.

The caster may choose to place his *hallucinatory terrain* over a comparatively small area (for instance, a throne room) or over a much larger one (for example, a hill). If he chooses to cast the spell on a larger terrain feature, the entire feature to be affected must be within the range of the spell. (A hill with greater than a 480' diameter would not be affected.)

The spell lasts until the illusion is touched by an intelligent creature, or until dispelled.

### Ice Storm/Wall of Ice

Range: 120'

Duration: Storm, 1 round; Wall, 12 turns

Effect: Storm in 20' x 20' x 20' volume; or Wall of 1,200 square feet

This spell may be cast in either of two ways: either as an icy blast, *ice storm*, or *wall of ice*.

An *ice storm* fills a 20' x 20' x 20' cube. If cast in a smaller area, it will remain 20' long at most. The storm inflicts 1d6 points of cold damage per

level of the caster to every creature in the area. Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells; if he is successful, he takes only half damage. Fire-type creatures (red dragons, flame salamanders, etc.) have a —4 penalty on their saving throws, but cold-type creatures (frost giant, frost salamander, etc.) are not affected by the spell.

A *wall of ice* is a thin vertical wall of any dimensions and shape determined by the spellcaster totalling 1,200 square feet or less (10' x 120', 30' x 40', etc.). The wall is opaque and will block sight. The wall must be cast to rest on the ground or similar support, and cannot be cast in a space occupied by another object.

Creatures of less than 4 Hit Dice or levels cannot break through the wall. Creatures of 4 HD or more levels can break through, but take 1d6 points of damage in the process. Fire-type creatures each take twice the amount of damage (2d6) while breaking through.

### Massmorph

Range: 240'

Duration: See below

Effect: Causes illusion of trees within 240' range

This spell will affect up to 100 human or man-sized creatures in a 240' diameter, making them appear to be the trees of an orchard, dense woods, or other large plant life appropriate to the region. (Unless the campaign's deserts feature very large cactus, the spell won't work in the desert.) Unwilling creatures are not affected. Creatures larger than man-size (such as horses) may be included, counting as two or three men

### Polymorph Self

Range: 0 (Caster only)

Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Caster may change shapes

This spell allows the caster to change shape, taking the physical form of another living creature. The Hit Dice of the new form must be equal to or less than the Hit Dice of the caster, or the spell will fail.

The caster's armor class, hit points, attack rolls, and saving throws do not change, and he does not gain special abilities (such as ghoul's paralysis) or special immunities of the new form; however, he does gain the natural physical abilities of the new form. For example, a spellcaster polymorphed into a frost giant has the strength of a frost giant and the ability to hurl boulders, but not immunity from cold. A spellcaster polymorphed into a dragon could fly but would not be able to use any breath weapons or spells.

The spellcaster cannot cast spells while polymorphed into a different form. The spell lasts for the listed duration, or until dispelled, or until the caster is killed. This spell will not enable the caster to take the form of a specific individual (see *polymorph other*).

### Remove Curse\*

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Removes any one curse

This spell removes one curse, whether on a character, item, or area. Some curses—especially

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

those on magical items—may only be temporarily removed, at the DM's discretion, requiring a clerical *dispel evil* spell for permanently removing the effects (or possibly a *remove curse* cast by a high-level spellcaster).

The reverse of this spell, *curse*, causes a misfortune or penalty to affect the recipient. Curses are limited only by the caster's imagination, but if an attempted curse is too powerful, it may return to the caster (DM's discretion)! Safe limits to curses may include: -4 penalty on attack rolls; -2 penalty to all saving throws; prime requisite reduced to half normal. The victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the *curse*.

## Wall of Fire

Range: 60'  
Duration: Concentration  
Effect: Creates 1200 square feet of fire

This spell creates a thin vertical wall of fire of any dimension and shape, determined by the spellcaster, totalling 1,200 square feet (for example, 10'x120', 20' x 60', 30'x40', etc.). The wall is opaque and will block sight. The wall cannot be cast as a space occupied by another object. It lasts as long as the caster concentrates, without moving, on it.

Creatures of less than 4 Hit Dice cannot break through the wall. Creatures of 4 HD or more can break through, but take 1d6 points of damage in the process. Undead and cold-using creatures (white dragons, frost giants, etc.) each take double damage while breaking through.

## Wizard Eye

Range: 240'  
Duration: 6 turns  
Effect: Creates movable invisible eye

This spell creates an invisible eye through which the caster can see. It is the size of a real eye and has invirvision (60' range). The *wizard eye* floats through the air at up to 120' per turn, but will not go through solid objects nor move more than 240' away from the caster. The spellcaster must concentrate (without moving) to see through the eye.

## Fifth Level Magical Spells

### Animate Dead

Range: 60'  
Duration: Permanent  
Effect: Creates zombies or skeletons

This spell allows the spellcaster to make animated, enchanted skeletons or zombies from normal skeletons or dead bodies within range. These animated undead creatures will obey the cleric until they are destroyed by another cleric or a *dispel magic* spell.

For each experience level of the cleric, he may animate one Hit Die of undead. A skeleton has the same Hit Die as the original creature, but a zombie has one Hit Die more than the original. Note that this *doesn't* count character experience levels as Hit Dice: For purposes of this spell, all humans and demihumans are 1 HD creatures, so the remains of a 9th level thief would be animated as a zombie with 2 HD.

Animated creatures do not have any spells.

but are immune to *sleep* and *charm* effects and poison. Lawful clerics must take care to use this spell only for good purpose. Animating the dead is usually a Chaotic act.

## Cloudkill

Range: 1'  
Duration: 6 turns  
Effect: Creates a moving poisonous cloud

This spell creates a circular cloud of poisonous vapor, 30' across and 20' tall, which appears next to the spellcaster. It moves away at the rate of 60' (20' per round) in any one direction (with the wind, if any; otherwise, in the direction chosen by the caster). This cloud is heavier than air and will sink when possible (going down holes, sliding downhill, etc.). The cloud will evaporate if it hits trees or thick vegetation. If cast in a small area (such as in a 10' tall dungeon corridor), the cloud may be of smaller than normal size.

All living creatures within the cloud take 1 point of damage per round. Any victim of less than 5 Hit Dice must make a saving throw vs. poison or be killed by the vapors.

## Conjure Elemental

Range: 240'  
Duration: Concentration  
Effect: Summons one 16 HD elemental

This spell allows the caster to summon any one elemental (AC -2, HD 16, Damage 3d8; see the description of elements in Chapter 14). The caster can only summon one of each type of elemental (earth, air, fire, water) in one day.

The elemental will perform any tasks within its power (carrying, attacking, etc.) as long as the caster maintains control by concentrating. The caster cannot fight, cast other spells, or move over half Normal Speed, else he will lose control of the elemental. If he loses control, he cannot regain it. An uncontrolled elemental will try to slay its summoner, and may attack anyone in its path while pursuing him.

The spell's caster may return a controlled elemental to its home plane simply by concentration. A *dispel magic* or *dispel evil* spell can return an uncontrolled elemental to its plane.

## Contact Outer Plane

Range: 0 (spellcaster only)  
Duration: See below  
Effect: 3-12 questions may be answered

This spell allows the spellcaster to contact one of the outer planes of existence to seek knowledge from an Immortal creature—a powerful magical being played by the DM. The wisest and most powerful Immortals live on the most distant outer planes. However, mental contact with an Immortal may cause a mortal to go insane. The more distant the plane, the greater the chance of a correct answer—but the greater the chance of insanity as well.

The number of questions the spellcaster may ask is equal to the "distance" to the outer plane. "Distance" to any other plane of existence is measured in the number of planes the character would have to cross in order to visit that plane. See the chart on page 264 to see where the various planes of existence lie in relation to one an-

other. The "distance" between the Prime Plane and the closest outer plane is 3—the Ethereal, elemental, and Astral Planes lie "between" them. There are many outer planes, many too far removed to be affected by this spell.

The caster may choose the distance, up to the maximum allowed. The DM checks the caster's chance of insanity once, when the Immortal is first contacted. If the caster is 21st level or greater, the chance of insanity is reduced by 5% per level of the caster above 20.

Even if insanity does not result, the Immortal may still not know the answer to the character's questions, or may lie, at the DM's discretion. If the DM does not wish just to decide whether the Immortal knows or is lying, he can roll on the chart below to determine this.

## Contact Outer Plane

| Distance &<br>Number of<br>Questions |     | Insanity | Chance of<br>Knowing | Lying* |
|--------------------------------------|-----|----------|----------------------|--------|
| 3                                    | 5%  | 25%      | 50%                  | 50%    |
| 4                                    | 10% | 30%      | 45%                  | 45%    |

\* Or not knowing

The spellcaster can use this spell once a month at most (or less often, at the DM's option). An insane character recovers with rest, after a number of weeks of game time equal to the number of the plane contacted.

## Dissolve\*

Range: 120'  
Duration: 3-18 days

Effect: Liquifies 3000 square feet

This spell changes a volume of soil or rock (but not a construction) to a morass of mud. An area up to 10' deep or thick is affected, and may have up to 3,000 square feet of surface area. The magic-user may choose the exact width and length (20' x 150', 30' x 100', etc.), but the entire area of effect must be within 240' of the caster. Creatures moving through the mud are slowed to 10% of their normal movement rate at best, and may become stuck (at the DM's discretion, a victim must make saving throw vs. spells to avoid becoming stuck).

The reverse of this spell (*harden*) will change the same volume of mud to rock, but permanently. A victim in the mud may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid being trapped in the hardened mud.

## Feeblemind

Range: 240'  
Duration: Permanent until dispelled  
Effect: Lowers Intelligence score to 2

This spell will only affect a magic-user, elf, or a monster which can cast magical spells; it does not affect those which cast only cleric or druid spells.

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_51_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_51_Picture_2.jpeg)

It will make the victim helpless, unable to cast spells or think clearly (as if the victim has an Intelligence score of 2). The victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect, but with a -4 penalty to the roll.

The *feeblemind* lasts until removed by a *dispel magic* spell (at normal chances for success) or by a cleric's *curseall* spell.

### Hold Monster\*

Range: 120'

Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn per level of the caster

Effect: Paralyzes 1-4 creatures

This spell has an effect identical to that of a *hold person* spell, but will affect any living creature. (It does not affect the undead.) Each victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or be paralyzed. The spell may be cast at a single creature or a group. If cast at a single creature, the victim takes a -2 penalty to his saving throw. If cast at a group, it will affect 1d4 creatures (of the spellcaster's choice, and within spell range), but with no penalties to the saving throw.

The reverse of this spell, *free monster*, removes the paralysis of up to four victims of *hold person* or *hold monster* spells. It has no other effect.

### Magic Jar

Range: 30'

Duration: See below

Effect: Take over one body

This spell causes the caster's body to fall into a trance, while the caster's life force is placed in an inanimate object (which is called a *magic jar* regardless of its form; it does not have to be an actual jar) within range. From this object, the caster's life force may attempt to take over any one creature within 120' of the *magic jar*. If the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. spells, the attempt fails and the caster may not try to take over that victim again for one turn. If the victim fails the saving throw, the caster takes over his body and the life force of the victim is placed into the *magic jar*.

The caster may cause the body to perform any normal actions, but not special abilities (similar to a *polymorph self effect*). A *dispel evil* spell will force the spellcaster's life force out of the victim's body and back into the magic jar. When the spellcaster returns to his or her real body, the victim's life force returns to his body and the spell ends.

If the possessed body is destroyed, the victim's life force dies, and the caster's life force returns to the *magic jar*. From there the caster may try to take over another body or return to the original body.

If the *magic jar* is destroyed while the caster's life force is within it, the caster is killed. If the *magic jar* is destroyed while the caster's life force is in a victim's body, the life force is stranded in that body, and the life force of the body's original owner is destroyed. If the caster's original body is destroyed, his life force is stranded in the *magic jar* until the caster can take over another body!

The taking over of another body is a Chaotic act.

### Passwall

Range: 30'

Duration: 3 turns

Effect: Creates a hole 10' deep

This spell causes a hole 5' diameter, 10' deep to appear in solid rock or stone only. The hole may be horizontal or vertical.

The stone reappears at the end of the duration. If someone is still in the tunnel when the stone reappears, he gets a saving throw vs. turn to stone. If he succeeds, he is hurled out the nearest end of the tunnel. If he fails, he is trapped within the reappearing stone, and dies.

### Telekinesis

Range: 120'

Duration: 6 rounds

Effect: 200 cn of weight per level of caster

This spell enables the spellcaster to move a creature or object simply by concentrating. The item may weigh up to 200 cn (20 lbs) per level of the caster (a 10th level elf could move an object weighing up to 2,000 cn, or 200 lbs). The caster may move the object in any direction, at a rate of up to 20' per round.

An unwilling victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. If he makes the roll, he doesn't budge. If a target is being held by someone, the holder can make a saving throw with a -2 penalty to retain the target item.

If the *telekinesis* grabs an object that is being carried but not held in the hand, the owner may grab for it as it is yanked away. To catch the departing object, he must make a saving throw vs. spells with a -5 penalty.

The caster must concentrate while moving objects, and the objects will fall if the caster is disturbed.

### Teleport

Range: 10'

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Transports one creature with equipment

This spell instantly transports the spellcaster or another recipient to any unoccupied destination on the same plane of existence. Distance does not matter so long as the destination is on the same plane. The recipient arrives at the destination with all equipment he was carrying. An unwilling victim can make a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the spell effects.

The caster may not deliberately choose a destination he knows to be occupied by a solid object, and he must choose to appear on a surface (such as ground level or the top of a building); he cannot choose to appear far up in the air.

Teleporting is dangerous; there is a chance the teleporter will appear in a solid object. The teleporter's chance of arriving safely depends on how carefully the caster has studied the area.

On the chart below, the DM determines how well the caster knows the destination.

### Teleport Chances

| Knowledge of Destination | Result  |       |          |
|--------------------------|---------|-------|----------|
| Casual                   | General | Exact | Success  |
| 01-50                    | 01-80   | 01-95 | Too High |
| 51-75                    | 81-90   | 96-99 | Too High |
| 76-00                    | 91-00   | 00    | Too Low  |

"Casual Knowledge" means that the caster has been there once or twice, or is visualizing the aiming point from descriptions or magical means. "General Knowledge" means the caster has been to the area often, or has spent several weeks studying the area magically (via *crystal ball*, etc.). "Exact Knowledge" means the caster has made a detailed personal study of the area.

Once the DM has determined how well the character knows the destination, the DM rolls d4. If the result is "Success," the teleporter arrives exactly where the caster desired.

If the result is "Too High," the recipient arrives 10' X 10' above the desired destination, then falls, taking damage on impact (1d6 points of damage per 10' fallen). (If he had already cast a *fly or levitate* spell, or already had a flying device operating, he can avoid this damage.)

If the result is "Too Low," the recipient arrives 1d10 x 10' below the desired location. Any creature teleporting into a solid object is instantly killed unless a vacant area (such as a cave or dungeon) lies at that point (DM's discretion).

### Wall of Stone

Range: 60'

Duration: Special

Effect: Creates 1000 cubic feet of stone

This spell creates a vertical stone wall exactly 2' thick. The caster chooses the wall's dimensions and shape, but its total area must be 500 square feet or less (10'X50', 20'X25', etc.), and the entire wall must be within 60' of the caster.

The caster must create the wall where the wall will rest on the ground or similar support, and cannot create the wall in a space already occupied by another object.

The wall lasts until it is dispelled or physically broken.

If a wall of stone topples, it causes 10d10 points of damage to what it hits, and it shatters.

### Woodform

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates 1,000 cubic feet of wood

This spell creates a mass of wood equal to 1,000 cubic feet; it may be arranged in any fashion the caster desires (10' x 10' x 10' block, 25' x 20' x 2' wall, etc.)

Casting time varies depending on the complexity of the design. A simple wall and other simple shapes take 1 round. A simple staircase may take 10 rounds (1 turn). A complicated design which is supposed to adhere to very tight specifications—such as the keel of a ship—could take the maximum time allowable, 12 turns (2 hours) just to work up in rough form. When the caster wants to try a complicated design, the DM decides how long the casting will take.

The object must be created as a single piece, with no moving parts. The original caster of the spell may later cast *woodform* on an object he has already created with the same spell, in order to modify it for up to two hours. This is how spellcaster artists often make fine woodcarvings, for instance. When he is satisfied with his work, he casts *woodform* on it one last time to "lock it in place," and it may no longer be modified by *woodform* spells.

![Decorative header image]()![](_page_52_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative header image]()![](_page_52_Picture_2.jpeg)

The mass of wood must be created so as to rest on the ground or similar support, and cannot be cast in a space occupied by another object.

A caster can create his wood with one or more rough sides, and later he or another caster can use another *woodform* to create wood perfectly joined to the first on that side—and there will be no seam or weakness at the joining. This makes it a good spell for creating strong ships and wooden buildings.

The caster may decide what sort of wood is created, within reason. The DM may refuse to allow the caster to pick very expensive, exotic, or magical woods.

The wood created by this spell is not dispellable; it lasts until broken through, burned, or destroyed by spells like *disintegrate*.

The armor class and hit points of building materials are given in the Fortifications Table on page 137. Based on those guidelines, a wall of wood has an AC of -4(6) and 60 hit points per 1' thickness. Most building exterior walls would be about 8" thick and have 40 hit points.

## Sixth Level Magical Spells

### Anti-Magic Shell

Range: 0 (Caster only)

Duration: 12 turns

Effect: Personal barrier which blocks magic

This spell creates an invisible barrier around the spellcaster's body (less than an inch away). The barrier stops all spells or spell effects, including the caster's. The caster may destroy the shell at will; otherwise, it lasts for the duration. Except for a *wish*, no magic (including a *dispel magic* spell) can cancel the barrier.

### Death Spell

Range: 240'

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Slays 4d8 (4-32) Hit Dice of creatures within a 60' x 60' x 60' area

This spell will affect 4d8 (4-32) Hit Dice of living creatures within the given area. Normal plants and insects are automatically slain, and those with no hit points (normal insects, plants smaller than shrub-sized, for instance) are not counted in the total affected. Undead are not affected, nor are creatures with 8 or more Hit Dice (or levels of experience).

The lowest Hit Dice creatures are affected first. Each victim must make a saving throw vs. death ray or die.

### Disintegrate

Range: 60'

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Destroys one creature or object

This spell causes one creature or nonmagical object to crumble to dust. A victim may make a saving throw vs. death ray to avoid the effect. (The spell can *disintegrate* a dragon, a ship, or a 10' section of wall, for example.)

The spell does not affect magical items or spell effects.

### Geas\*

Range: 30'

Duration: Until completed or removed

Effect: Compels one creature

This spell forces a victim either to perform or avoid a stated action. For example, a character may be *geased* to bring back an object for the caster, to eat whenever the chance arises, or never to reveal certain information. The action must be possible and not directly fatal or else the *geas* will return and affect the caster instead!

When the spell is first cast, the victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the spell's effect.

If the victim ignores the *geas*, penalties (decided by the DM) are applied until the character either obeys the *geas* or dies. Suitable penalties include penalties in combat, lowered ability scores, loss of spells, pain and weakness, and so forth. *Dispel magic* and *remove curse* spells will not affect a *geas*.

The *geas* makes the victim perform an action, but does not make him think it is his own idea: Once he finishes performing his task, he may decide to exact revenge on the spellcaster.

The reverse of this spell, *remove geas*, will rid a character of an unwanted *geas* and its effects. However, if the caster is of a lower level than the caster of the original *geas*, there is a chance of failure (5% per level difference).

### Invisible Stalker

Range: 0 (Caster only)

Duration: Until mission is accomplished

Effect: Summons one creature

This spell summons an *invisible stalker* (from Chapter 14) which will perform one task for the caster. The creature will serve the caster regardless of the time or distance involved, until the task is completed or until the creature is slain. A *dispel evil* spell will force the creature to return to its home plane.

### Lower Water

Range: 240'

Duration: 10 turns

Effect: Cuts depths to half normal

This spell causes a body of water to lower to half its normal depth. It will effect an area up to 10,000 square feet (width and length). If cast on a constantly-renewed source of water (such as a river or ocean), it lowers that area of water for the entire duration of the spell (or until it is dispelled); surrounding water does not rush in until the spell is ended. If cast around a boat or ship, the vessel may become stuck.

At the end of the spell's duration, the sudden rush of water filling the "hole" will sweep a ship's deck clear of most items (and people who fail their saving throws vs. spells) and cause 1d12 + 20 (21-32) points of hull damage.

This spell can turn a rampaging river into a river which the heroes' party can ford, can cause some pools to lower far enough for the adventurers to see what's deeper in them, etc. If cast around a boat or ship, this spell may cause the bay or river to drop enough for the vessel to become stuck.

### Move Earth

Range: 240'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Moves soil

This spell causes soil (but not rock) to move. The caster can use the spell to move earth horizontally to make a hill, or vertically, to open a large hole (one up to 240' deep, unless it reaches solid rock). The spell moves the soil at up to 60' per turn, and at the end of the spell duration, the moved soil remains where it is put. This spell is helpful for constructing castles.

### Projected Image

Range: 240'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Creates one image

This spell creates an image of the caster up to 240' away; the image will last without concentration. The *projected image* cannot be distinguished from the original except by touch. Any spell the spellcaster casts will seem to come from the image, but the caster must still be able to see the target.

Spells and missile attacks will not appear to affect the image. If the image is touched or struck by a hand-to-hand weapon, it disappears.

### Reincarnation

Range: 10'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates a new body

To cast this spell, the magic-user must have a part (however small) of a dead body. The spell magically creates a new body, and the life force which was once in the dead body returns and inhabits the new one. The DM can choose what sort of body is created, or can refer to the tables below to decide.

If the life force is *reincarnated* as a different race, all details of the new race apply, instead of the old. For example, a cleric reincarnated as an elf is no longer a cleric, but is able to cast magic-user spells and fight as an elf.

The victim's level of experience does not change unless restricted by the maximum for demihumans. If the victim is reincarnated in a monster body, the victim's alignment helps determine the type of monster which appears; a character will not be reincarnated in the body of a monster that cannot have his alignment. A monster body may not gain levels of experience; the character must play as the reincarnated creature, or retire from play, or (perhaps) be *reincarnated* again when slain.

### Reincarnation Results

Type of Body Appearing (Roll 1d8)

| 1 Human | 5 Elf                    |
|---------|--------------------------|
| 2 Human | 6 Halfling               |
| 3 Human | 7 Original race          |

\* Any normal bear

The DM may add more monsters to the lists. Such monsters should have 8 Hit Dice or less and should be at least semi-intelligent.

## Stone to Flesh\*

Range: 120'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: One creature or object

This spell turns any one statue (or quantity of stone up to 10' x 10' x 10') to flesh. It is usually used to restore a character turned to stone (by gorgon breath, for example).

The reverse of this spell, *flesh to stone*, will turn one living creature, including all equipment carried, to stone. The victim may make a saving throw vs. turn to stone to avoid the effect.

## Stoneform

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates 1,000 cubic feet of stone

This spell creates a mass of stone equal to 1,000 cubic feet; it may be arranged in any fashion the caster desires (10' x 10' x 10' block, 25' x 20' x 2' wall, etc.).

Casting time varies depending on the complexity of the design. A simple wall and other simple shapes take 1 round. A simple staircase may take 10 rounds (1 turn). A complicated design meant to adhere to very tight specifications—such as an ornate fountain or statue—could take the maximum time allowable, 12 turns (2 hours), just to work up in rough form. When the caster wants to try a complicated or unusual design, the DM decides how long the casting will take.

The object must be created as a single piece, with no moving parts. The original caster of the spell may later cast *Stoneform* on an object he has already created with the same spell in order to modify it for up to two hours. This is how magic-user artists often make fine statues, for instance. When he is satisfied with his work, the magic-user casts *Stoneform* on it one last time to "lock it in place," and it may no longer be modified by *Stoneform* spells.

The mass of stone must be created to rest on the ground or similar support, and cannot be cast in a space occupied by another object.

A caster can create his stone with one or more rough sides, and later he or another caster can use another *Stoneform* to create stone joined to the first on that side—and there will be no seam or weakness at the joining. This makes it a good spell for creating strong walls and gigantic buildings—colisea, palaces, etc.

The caster may decide what sort of stone is created, within reason. The DM may refuse to allow the caster to pick very expensive, exotic, or magical stones. Valuable jade, for instance, is an in-

appropriate choice. However, a caster can choose such stones as clear lead crystal, and so make thick, strong, perfect windows with this spell.

The stone is not dispellable; it lasts until broken or destroyed by spells like *disintegrate*.

The armor class and hit points of building materials are given on the Fortifications Table on page 137. In general, from those guidelines, stone walls have an AC of -4(6) and 100 hit points per 1' thickness; doing 500 hit points of damage to a 5' wall will definitely knock a hole in it. Building exterior walls tend to be about 7" thick and have 60 hit points.

## Wall of Iron

Range: 120'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates 500 square feet of iron

This spell creates a vertical wall of iron exactly 2' thick. The magic-user may choose any length and width, but the total area must be 500 square feet or less (10'X50', 20'X25', etc.), and the entire wall must be within 120' of the caster. The caster must create the wall so it rests on the ground or similar support. It cannot be cast in a space occupied by another object. It lasts until dispelled, disintegrated, or physically broken (though it will resist all but giant-sized physical attacks). Most other spell effects, including *fireball*, *lightning bolt*, etc., have no effect on a *wall of iron*. If the wall is made to topple, it causes 10d10 (10-100) points of damage to whatever it hits, and shatters.

If the wall is attacked, it has a number of hit points equal to the level of the caster. A rust monster can destroy a *wall of iron* with a single touch. Otherwise, the wall can only be damaged by battering; see Chapter 9 (page 118) for more on battering attacks.

## Weather Control

Range: 0 (magic-user only)

Duration: Concentration

Effect: All weather within 240 yards

This spell allows the magic-user to create one special weather condition in the surrounding area (within a 240 yard radius). The spellcaster may select the weather condition. The spell only works outdoors, and the weather will affect all creatures in the area (including the caster). The effects last as long as the spellcaster concentrates, without moving; if the caster is being moved (for example, aboard a ship), the effect moves also. The spell's effects vary, but the following results are typical:

**Rain:** -2 penalty to attack rolls applies to all missile fire. After three turns, the ground becomes muddy, reducing movement to half the normal rate.

**Snow:** Visibility (the distance a creature can see) is reduced to 20'; movement is reduced to half the normal rate. Rivers and streams may freeze over. Mud remains after the snow thaws, for the same movement penalty.

**Fog:** 20' visibility, half normal movement. Those within the fog might become lost, moving in the wrong direction.

**Clear:** This cancels bad weather (rain, snow, fog) but not secondary effects (such as mud).

**Intense Heat:** Movement reduced to half nor-

mal. Excess water (from rain, snow, mud transmuted from rock, etc.) dries up.

**High Winds:** No missile fire or flying is possible. Movement reduced to half normal. At sea, ships sailing with the wind move 50% faster. In the desert, high winds create a sandstorm, for half normal movement and 20' visibility.

**Tornado:** This creates a whirlwind under the magic-user control, attacking and moving as if it was a 12 HD air elemental. At sea, treat the tornado as a storm or gale.

## Seventh Level Magical Spells

### Charm Plant

Range: 120'

Duration: 6 months (see below)

Effect: Charms one tree or more smaller plants

Similar to a *charm person* spell, this effect causes one tree, six medium-sized bushes, 12 small shrubs, or 24 small plants to become friends of the magic-user (no saving throw). However, a plant-like monster (treant, shrieker, etc.) may make a saving throw vs. spells to resist the effect.

The *charmed* plants will understand and obey all commands of the magic-user, as long as the tasks are within their ability (including the entangling of passers-by within range, but not including movement, sensing alignment, etc.). The plants will remain *charmed* for six months, until the charm is dispelled, or until winter (when they sleep). (This spell is quite useful around a stronghold, both inside and out, especially when used after a 4th level *growth of plants* spell, and possibly a *permanence* as well.)

### Create Normal Monsters

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 turn

Effect: Creates 1 or more monsters

This spell causes monsters to appear out of thin air. All monsters appearing will understand and obey the caster's commands—fighting, carrying or fetching things, etc. They will faithfully obey all commands to the best of their abilities. Each monster will appear carrying its normal weapons and wearing its normal armor (if any), but arrives otherwise unequipped. At the end of one turn, all the monsters created vanish back into thin air, along with all their equipment. (If a monster has dropped a weapon while fighting and then vanishes, the weapon disappears, too.)

The total number of Hit Dice of monsters appearing is equal to the level of the magic-user casting the spell. (If the spellcaster's level is not an exact multiple of the monsters' Hit Dice, drop all fractions). The magic-user may choose the exact type of monsters created, but he must select only monsters with no special abilities (i.e., no asterisk next to the Hit Die number in the monster explanation). This spell does not create humans, demihumans, or undead. Creatures of 1-1 Hit Dice are counted as 1 Hit Die; creatures of 1-1 Hit Die or less are counted as 1/2 Hit Die each.

**Example:** With this spell, a 15th level caster could summon 30 giant bats, rats, or kobolds (1/2 Hit Die monsters); or 15 goblins, orcs, or hobgoblins (1 Hit Die monsters); or 7 rock ba-

boons, gnolls, or lizard men (2 Hit Die monsters); or 5 boars, draco lizards, or bugbears (3 Hit Die monsters); or 3 black bears, panthers, or giant weasels (5 Hit Die monsters); and so forth.

## Delayed Blast Fireball

Range: 240'

Duration: 0 to 60 rounds

Effect: Delayed blast fireball of 20' radius

As the name implies, this is a *fireball* spell whose blast can be delayed; it behaves like a time bomb. When he casts the spell, the magic-user states the exact number of rounds of delay (from 0 to 60) until the spell detonates. A small rock, very similar in appearance to a valuable gem, then shoots out toward the desired location, and remains at that location until the stated delay elapses. The "gem" may be picked up, carried, and so forth.

When the stated duration ends, it explodes in an effect identical to a normal *fireball*—a sudden instantaneous explosion inflicting 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster to all within the area of effect (a sphere of 20' radius). Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to take half damage.

Once the spell has been cast, the explosion cannot be hurried nor further delayed, except with a *wish*. The "gem" created is pure magic, not an actual object, and cannot be moved magically (by *telekinesis*, *teleport*, etc.); however, it can be dispelled.

## Ironform

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates 500 square feet of iron

This spell creates a wall of iron 2" thick (or less) with an area equal to 500 square feet; it may be arranged in any fashion the caster desires (10' x 50' wall, or 25' X 20' wall, etc.)

Casting time varies depending on the complexity of the design. A simple wall and other simple shapes take 1 round. A simple staircase may take 10 rounds (1 turn). A complicated design which is supposed to adhere to very tight specifications—such as a giant portcullis—could take the maximum time allowable, 12 turns (2 hours) just to create in rough form. When the caster wants to try a complicated or unusual design, the DM decides how long the casting will take.

The object must be created as a single piece, with no moving parts. The original caster of the spell may later cast *ironform* on an object he has already created with the same spell, in order to modify it for up to two hours. This is how magic-user artists often make fine iron statues, for instance. When he is satisfied with his work, he casts *ironform* on it one last time to "lock it in place," and it may no longer be modified by ironform spells.

The iron wall must be created to rest on the ground or similar support, and cannot be cast in a space occupied by another object. Unlike the metal created by the *wall of iron* spell, it does not have to be created in a vertical position.

A caster can create his iron with one or more tough sides, and later he or another caster can use another *ironform* to create iron joined to the

first on that side—and there will be no seam or weakness at the joining. This makes it a good spell for creating iron reinforcements for walls.

The iron so created is not dispellable; it lasts until broken or destroyed by spells like *disintegrate* or creatures such as rust monsters.

The armor class and hit points of building materials are given in the Fortifications Table on page 137. Following these general guidelines, we find that an iron wall will have an AC of —10(2) and about 15 hit points per 1" thickness.

## Lore

Range: 0 (magic-user only)

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Reveals details of 1 item, place, or person

By means of this spell, the magic-user may gain knowledge of one item, place, or person. If the caster holds the item being studied, the spell takes 1d4 turns to complete, and the magic-user learns the item's name, method of operation and command words (if any), and approximate number of charges (if any, within five of the correct number).

If the item has more than one mode of operation, or more than one command word, only one function will be revealed for each *lore* spell used, and the spell will not even hint that the object has any other functions.

If the spell is being used to investigate a place or person, or an item which the caster is not holding, the spell may take 1d100 days to complete. A purely legendary topic should require large amounts of time, and the information gained may be in the form of a riddle or poem. The Dungeon Master should reveal only general details if the place is large, or if the person is of great power.

## Magic Door\*

Range: 10'

Duration: 7 uses

Effect: Creates one passage

This spell may be cast on any wall, floor, ceiling, or section of ground. It creates a magical, invisible doorway that only the spellcaster may use. It also creates a passage through up to 10' of non-living solid material beyond the doorway itself. It cannot be created in a living object of any kind. The door is undetectable except by a *detect magic* spell, and cannot be destroyed except by a *dispel magic* spell (at normal chances for success).

The *magic door* lasts until dispelled, or until it has been used seven times. Note that each one-way passage through the door is counted as a separate use.

The reverse of this spell, *magic lock*, is a powerful version of the 2nd level *wizard lock* spell, but cannot be affected by a *knock* spell or by the effects of any magical item. The *magic lock* causes any one portal to become totally impassable as long as the magic remains; only the spell-caster can use the portal. The spell can affect an empty 10' X 10' portal-like area (such as an empty doorway). The *locked* portal does not change in appearance. As with a *magic door*, the enchantment remains until the portal has been used seven times or until removed by a *dispel magic* spell.

## Mass Invisibility\*

Range: 240'

Duration: Permanent until broken

Effect: Creatures or objects in 60' square area

This bestows *invisibility* (as the 2nd level spell) on several creatures. All the recipients must be within an area 60' square within 240' of the magic-user. The spell will affect up to 6 dragon-sized creatures, or up to 300 man-sized creatures. After the spell is cast, each creature becomes invisible, along with all equipment it carries (as per the *invisibility* spell, above). An invisible creature will remain invisible until he or she attacks or casts any spell.

The reverse of this spell, (appear), will cause all invisible creatures and objects in a 20' x 20' x 20' volume to become visible. Creatures on the Astral and Ethereal planes are *not* within the area of effect; the spell cannot reach across planar boundaries. All other forms of invisibility are affected, both magical and natural, and all victims of this spell cannot become invisible again for one full turn.

## Power Word Stun

Range: 120'

Duration: 2d6 or 1d6 turns

Effect: Stuns 1 creature of 70 hp or less

This lets the caster stun one victim within 120' (no saving throw). A victim with 1-35 hit points is stunned for 2d6 turns; a victim with 36-70 hit points is stunned for 1d6 turns. No creature with 71 or greater hit points is affected.

## Reverse Gravity

Range: 90'

Duration: 1/5 round (2 seconds)

Effect: Causes caster in a 30' cubic volume to fall upward

This spell affects all creatures and objects within a cubic volume 30' x 30' x 30', causing them to "fall" in a direction opposite the normal gravity. In two seconds, creatures and objects can "fall" a maximum of 65'. No saving throw is allowed, and all victims hitting a ceiling or other obstruction take 1d6 points of damage per 10' "fallen." Note that after the two seconds have elapsed, gravity returns to normal and all victims will fall back to their original places, suffering more falling damage. The DM should make a morale check for each NPC victim of this spell.

*Example:* A magic-user casts this spell at a group of approaching giants in a 40' tall room. The giants "fall" to the ceiling and then back to the floor, each taking a total of 8d6 points of damage in the process: 4d6 from "falling" up and hitting the ceiling, and another 4d6 from falling back down to the floor.

## Statue

Range: 0 (Magic-user only)

Duration: 2 turns per level of the caster

Effect: Allows caster to turn to stone

This allows the magic-user to change into a statue, along with all nonliving equipment he carries, up to once per round (to or from statue form) for the duration of the spell. The caster can concentrate on other spells while in statue

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_55_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_55_Picture_2.jpeg)

for, though he can cast no new spells while in this form. Although this spell does not give him immunity to "turn to stone" effects (from a gorgon's attack), the caster may simply turn back to normal one round after becoming petrified.

While in statue form, the magic-user is armor class -4, but cannot move. He cannot be damaged by cold or fire (whether normal or magical) or by normal weapons. He does not breathe, and is thus immune to all gas attacks, drowning, etc. Magical weapons and other spells (such as *lightning boh*) inflict normal damage on him. If a fire or cold spell is cast at the magic-user while in normal form, the character need only win initiative (with a +2 bonus) to turn into a statue before the attacking spell strikes.

## Summon Object

Range: Infinite

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Retrieves one object from caster's home

By means of this spell, the magic-user can cause one nonliving object to leave the spellcasters's home and appear in his hand. The object must weigh no more than 500 cn (50 pounds), and may be no bigger than a staff or small chest. The spellcaster must be very familiar with the item and its exact location, or the spell will not work. The caster must also have prepared the item beforehand by sprinkling it with a special powder that costs 1,000 gold pieces per item prepared; the powder becomes invisible and does not interfere with the item in any way. The spell cannot summon items that have not been prepared in this fashion.

If the magic-user prepares a chest for use with this spell, fills the chest with weapons and magical items, and then later tries to summon it to him, the chest appears—empty. All its contents stay behind, where the chest originally stood, since they have not been magically prepared for use with the spell, and since the spell can summon only one prepared object at a time.

If another being possesses the item summoned, it will not appear, but the caster will know approximately who and where the possessor is.

The magic-user may use this spell from any location, even if the item summoned is on another plane of existence.

## Sword

Range: 30'

Duration: 1 round per level of the caster

Effect: Creates a magical sword

When this spell is cast, a glowing sword made of magic, rather than metal, appears next to the caster. The magic-user may cause it to attack any creature within 30', simply by concentrating; the sword flies to the target and attacks. If the caster's concentration is broken, the sword merely stops attacking. It remains in existence for one round per level of the spellcaster.

The sword moves very quickly, attacking twice per round and making its attack rolls at the caster's level. Damage is the same as a two-handed sword (1d10), but this magical creation is capable of hitting any target (even those hit only by powerful magical weapons).

The sword cannot be destroyed before the duration ends, except by a *dispel magic* spell effect

(at normal chances of success) or a *wish*.

## Teleport Any Object

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Causes 1 object to teleport

This spell is similar to the 5th level *teleport* spell, but nonliving objects can be affected. After casting this spell, the spellcaster may touch one creature or object and cause it to teleport. The normal chance of error apply (see the description of the *teleport* spell above) an object appearing too high will fall and probably break, while one appearing too low will be destroyed instantly. If the spellcaster uses this spell to teleport himself, there is no chance for error. The caster may not deliberately choose a destination occupied by a solid object or in open air above the ground.

The maximum weight affected is 500 cn (50 pounds) per level of the caster. If an object is a solid part of a greater whole (such as a section of wall), the spell will teleport a maximum of one  $10' \times 10' \times 10'$  cube of material. If the caster is trying to teleport a creature that weighs more than the spell allows, the spell fails.

If another creature holds or carries the item which the caster is trying to teleport, the creature may make a saving throw vs. spells (with a -2 penalty). If the saving throw is successful, the teleport fails.

If the caster touches another creature, the target creature may make a saving throw vs. spells (if so desired) to avoid being teleported, but with a -2 penalty to the roll.

## Eighth Level Magical Spells

### Clone

Range: 10'

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Grows one duplicate creature from a piece of the original creature

A clone is an exact duplicate of another living creature, grown from a piece of the original through the use of this spell. The piece need not be alive at the time the spell is cast.

A human or demihuman clone is rare and may be very dangerous. A clone of any other living creature is a more common thing called a simulacrum. A character can have only one clone at a time; attempts at making multiple clones of a single character automatically fail. Undead and constructs cannot be *cloned*, because they are not living creatures. (You could *clone* someone from flesh taken before that person became undead, but he would not be subject to the effects described below for situations where two examples of the same person exist.)

*Human and demihuman clones:* To create a human or demihuman clone, this spell must be cast on one pound of the person's flesh. This spell requires the caster to use up other materials costing 3,000 gold pieces per Hit Die of the original. The clone awakens only when fully grown; this takes one week per Hit Die of the clone. When completed, the clone is not magical and cannot be dispelled.

If the human or demihuman original is not alive when the clone awakens, the clone has all

the features, statistics (abilities), and memories possessed by the original at the time the flesh was taken. This is a very important point. For example, a 20th level magic-user might leave a pound of flesh with a scroll of this spell, so that he might be restored if lost; but if the character gains another ten levels of experience and then dies, the clone will be the younger, less-experienced, 20th level form.

If a clone duplicates a person still living, or if the original person regains life, a very hazardous situation develops. Each form instantly becomes aware of the other's existence. A partial mind-link exists between them; each can feel the other's emotions (but no other thoughts). If either one is damaged, the other takes the same damage (but may make a saving throw vs. spells to take half damage). This effect does not apply to *charm*, *sleep*, cures, or other effects that do not cause damage.

The clone is immediately obsessed with the need to destroy its original and will do anything to accomplish this. From the time a clone becomes aware of its original, it has one day per level of its creator (i.e., the caster of the *clone* spell) to kill the original.

*Example:* A 25th level fighter dies. His friend the 34th level magic-user, who possesses a pound of the fighter's flesh for this precise purpose, *clones him*. Then someone else raises the fighter from the dead. The clone becomes aware of his original and is compelled to kill him. He has 34 days to do so—one day for every experience level of his creator.

If the clone succeeds in killing its original, it can continue with its life normally; but if it fails and does not immediately die, it becomes insane.

When a clone goes insane, the original creature permanently loses one point of Intelligence and one point of Wisdom. The original may also thereafter become insane (5% chance per day, not cumulative). If this occurs, the victim and the clone die one week later, both forever dead and unrecoverable even with a *wish*.

*Special Note:* If the original and the clone are kept on different planes of existence, no mind-link occurs, and the clone is not compelled to kill its original. No ill effects occur, and the two remain completely unaware of their situation. If they ever occupy the same plane, the mind-link occurs and cannot be broken thereafter except by the destruction of the clone or its original.

*Other clones:* A clone of any other living creature (not a human or demihuman) is called a simulacrum. One percent of the original's flesh is needed, and the cost of other materials is 500 gold pieces per hit point of the original. As with a normal clone, the time required to grow a simulacrum is one week per Hit Die of the original.

A simulacrum always obeys its creator (the spellcaster). It understands all the languages spoken by the caster. Within a range of 10' per level of the caster, it can receive mental commands if the creator concentrates on sending them.

A simulacrum is an enchanted monster. It can be blocked by a *protection from evil* spell and is magical; a *dispel magic* spell can (subject to normal chances of failure for that spell) cause it to vanish without a trace.

## Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

The simulacrum's alignment is the same as that of the spellcaster, regardless of the original creature's alignment. Its armor class, movement rate, morale, and number of attacks are the same as the original's.

A simulacrum has only 50% of the original's Hit Dice, hit points, and damage per attack. The DM rolls d100 for each special ability; it is present in the simulacrum if the result is 01-50. However, a freshly grown simulacrum never has any of the spells or spell-like abilities of the original.

If the original creature is alive, the simulacrum does not grow beyond this point. If the original creature dies (or is already dead), the simulacrum continues to increase in abilities, gaining an additional 5% per week to a maximum of 90% of the original's statistics. When complete, the DM rolls again to see which special abilities previously missing are gained, including spells and spell-like abilities (using the 90% chance for each; all may be present).

### Create Magical Monsters

Range: 60'

Duration: Two turns

Effect: Creates one or more monsters

This spell is similar to the 7th level *create normal monsters* spell, except that it can create monsters with some special abilities (up to two asterisks). The range and duration are double those of the lesser spell. All other details are the same: the creatures are chosen by the caster, appear out of thin air, and vanish at the end of the spell duration.

The total number of Hit Dice of monsters appearing is equal to the level of the magic-user casting the spell (again, dropping fractions if the caster's level is not an exact multiple of the creatures' Hit Dice). The spell does not create humans or demihumans, but can create undead. Creatures of 1-1 Hit Die count as 1 Hit Die; creatures of 1/2 Hit Die or less count as 1/2 Hit Die each.

Special Note: This spell can create a construct (as defined in Chapter 14) if the spellcaster uses the materials normally required for the construct's creation. Only one construct will appear, regardless of the caster's Hit Dice; but it is permanent, and does not vanish at the end of the spell duration—though it still may be dispelled at normal chances of success. This construct may have only two asterisks (special abilities) or less; see Chapter 14 for lists of the known types of constructs and the number of special abilities they have. The cost of materials is a minimum of 5,000 gold pieces per asterisk (or more, depending on your campaign). Chapter 16 contains more rules for enchanting magical items (including constructs), and has suggestions regarding nondispellable constructs.

### Dance

Range: Touch

Duration: 3 or more rounds

Effect: Causes 1 victim to dance

This spell causes one victim to prance madly about, performing a jig or other dance, for 3 or more rounds. The magic-user must touch the victim for the spell to take effect (a normal attack roll). The victim gets no saving throw, and can-

not attack, use spells (or spell-like abilities), or flee. While dancing, the victim suffers a —4 penalty to his saving throws, and a +4 penalty to his armor class.

The duration is three rounds for a caster of 18th to 20th level; four rounds for levels 21-24, five rounds at levels 25-28, six rounds at levels 29-32, and seven rounds at levels 33-36.

### Explosive Cloud

Range: 1'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Creates a moving poisonous cloud

This spell creates an effect which looks identical to the 5th level *cloudkill spell* (a 20' tall cloud of greenish gas 30' in diameter appearing next to the caster). The cloud is only mildly poisonous; all victims within it must make a saving throw vs. spells or be paralyzed that round. Each victim within the cloud makes a new saving throw each round.

The cloud is filled with sparkling lights (visible only to those within it), which are small explosions. Each round, all those within the cloud take damage from the explosions, with no saving throw allowed. This damage is 1 point for each two levels of experience of the magic-user, rounded down (9 points at 18th or 19th level, 10 points at 20th or 21st level, etc.). This explosive damage will affect any creature, including those immune to fire, gas, electricity, and other special attacks.

### Force Field

Range: 120'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Creates an invisible barrier

This spell creates an invisible, immovable barrier or object of pure force. It has almost no thickness, but cannot be broken or destroyed by any means except a *disintegrate* spell or a *wish*; even a *dispel magic* spell cannot affect it. A *force field*'s shape is limited to a sphere, hemisphere, a flat surface, a cylinder, a square or rectangular box with flat sides, or part of such a box. The sphere's radius can be a maximum of 20'. The flat surface or combinations thereof may be up to 5,000 square feet in total area. The *force field* cannot be irregular in shape, and its surface must be perfectly smooth. It can be as small as the caster desires.

The *force field* will not appear within any solid or creature. Any part of it that would do so will not appear, leaving a hole in the *force field*—normally, a hole large enough for the victim to escape through. Furthermore, the edges of the field are blunt and cannot cause damage in any way. The *force field* will stay where it is put until it disappears, and cannot be moved by any means but a *wish*.

Creature(s) completely enclosed by a sealed *force field* will not starve, suffer from lack of air, or otherwise be harmed by the encasement. A sealed *force field* magically preserves any within it from natural death. This does not prevent damage or death from attacks by others within the *force field*.

Nothing can pass through a *force field*. Spells, missiles, blows, breath weapons, and all other attack forms merely bounce off it. However, a

*teleport* or *dimension door* spell can bypass it; these spells allow the caster to travel into or out of the field without harming the field. The force *field exists* only on one plane of existence. Thus, planar travel (via *gate* or other means) can also bypass it.

Though most often used as a barrier or cage, a *force field* can easily be used to create an invisible floor, stairway, chair, or other object. A *force field* can be made permanent, but the *permanence* spell is still subject to *dispel magic*, and if removed, the *force field* disappears immediately. Even if treated with a *permanence* spell, a *force field* will always vanish if struck by a *disintegrate* spell or *wished* away.

### Mass Charm\*

Range: 120'

Duration: Special (as *charm person* spell)

Effect: 30 Levels of creatures

This spell creates the same effect as a *charm person* or *charm monster* spell, except that the spell affects 30 levels (or Hit Dice) at once. Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the *charm*, but with a -2 penalty to the roll. The spell will not affect a creature of 31 or more levels or Hit Dice.

The duration of each *charm* is determined by the victim's Intelligence (see *charm person*, above). If the magic-user attacks one of the *charmed* victims, only that one creature's *charm* is automatically broken. Any other *charmed* creatures seeing the attack may make another saving throw, but other creatures' *charms* are not affected.

The reverse of this spell, *remove charm*, will unafflictingly remove all *charm* effects within a 20' x 20' x 20' volume. It will also prevent any object in that area from creating *charm* effects for one turn.

### Mind Barrier\*

Range: 10'

Duration: 1 hour per level of the caster

Effect: Protects against mind-affecting spells and items

This spell affects one creature; an unwilling recipient may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect.

The spell prevents any form of *ESP*, *clairvoyance*, *clairaudience*, *crystal ball* gazing, or any other form of mental influence or information gathering (such as by a *contact higher plane* or *summon object*) from working on the target creature. The caster or recipient simply does not exist for the purposes of those and similar spell effects for the duration of the *mind barrier spell*.

In addition, the recipient gains a bonus of +8 to saving throws against mind-influencing attacks, such as all forms of *charm*, *illusion* and *phantasm*, *feeblemind*, and the like. (However, a roll of 1 always fails the saving throw, regardless of adjustments.)

The reverse of this spell, *open mind*, causes the victim touched to be vulnerable to all the mind-influencing attacks given above. All the victim's saving throws against such effects are penalized by -8 for the duration of the spell. This reversed spell must be cast by touch, requiring a normal attack roll.

## Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_57_Picture_2.jpeg)

### Permanence

Range: 10'

Duration: Permanent until dispelled

Effect: Causes one magical effect to become permanent

By means of this spell, the magic-user can cause one other magic-user spell effect of 7th level or less to become permanent. This spell will not make permanent any spell which has an "instantaneous" or "permanent" duration (such as *dispel magic*, *fireball*, *lightning bolt*, etc.); clerical spells and 8th or 9th level magic-user spells also cannot be made permanent.

The DM can declare that the *permanence* spell will not work with any other specific spell. Whenever a character wishes to cast the spell, the DM should carefully consider whether *permanence* will affect the other spell. Certain spell combinations could seriously affect a campaign's game balance, and the DM should carefully regulate all uses of this spell.

A *permanence* spell lasts until dispelled by a *dispel magic* spell from either the caster or some higher-level spellcaster (at normal chances for success). When the *permanence* spell is dispelled, the other spell effect vanishes immediately.

Except for weapons, an item can only receive one *permanence* spell, and a creature can receive two at most. If a *permanence* spell is cast on an item or area that already has one in effect (or a creature which already has two, or a weapon which already has five), both *permanence* spells automatically fail. A weapon may have up to five permanent effects, but a 25% (noncumulative) chance of failure applies to each *permanence* after the first. Furthermore, if the *permanence* fails, it destroys the weapon completely.

Some spells used on a creature that are commonly made permanent are: *detect magic*, *protection from evil*, *read languages*, *read magic*, *detect invisible*, and *fly*. Some spells commonly made permanent on areas are *light*, *phantasmal force*, *confusion*, and *cloudkill*.

A magic-user does not need a *permanence* spell to make any permanent magical item. Using *permanence* to bind a spell to an object is not the same as *enchanting* the object. Enchanted objects are more durable and permanent than objects which have merely had spells permanently placed upon them.

### Polymorph any Object

Range: 240'

Duration: See below

Effect: Changes form of one object or creature

This spell is similar to the 4th level *polymorph others* spell, except that it will affect objects as well as creatures. If the object is part of a greater whole (such as a section of wall), the spell will affect up to a  $10' imes 10' imes 10'$  volume. A creature may avoid the effects if it successfully makes a saving throw vs. spells is made at a -4 penalty to the roll.

The duration of the polymorph depends on the degree of the change. There are three basic kingdoms of all things—animal, vegetable, and mineral. If an object is polymorphed to one of a nearby kingdom (animal-vegetable, vegetable-mineral) the spell's duration is one hour per level

of the caster. If the change is from animal to mineral (or the reverse), it lasts for one turn per level of the caster. If no change in kingdom occurs (for example, if a creature is polymorphed into some other creature), the change is permanent until removed by a *dispel magic* spell (at normal chances for success).

Note that creatures created by means of this spell are not automatically friendly. A *polymorph* cannot affect a creature's age or hit points. (See the 4th level *polymorph self* and *polymorph others* spells for other guidelines.)

This spell will not affect a creature which has more than 2 x the spellcaster's experience levels in Hit Dice. For example, a 20th level magic-user cannot affect a creature with 41 or more Hit Dice.

### Power Word Blind

Range: 120'

Duration: 1-4 days or 2-8 hours (see below)

Effect: Blinds 1 creature with 80 hit points or less

With this spell, the caster may *blind* one victim within 120' (no saving throw). A victim with 1-40 hit points is blinded for 1d4 days; one with 41-80 hit points is blinded for 2d4 hours. The spell does not affect creatures with 81 or more hit points.

A *blinded* victim suffers penalties of -4 on all saving throws and +4 on armor class. A cleric's *curse blindness* or *curse all* spell will not remove this blindness unless the cleric is of a level equal to or higher than the caster of the power *word blind*.

### Steelform

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates up to 500 square feet of steel

This spell is effectively identical to the 7th level *ironform* spell. However, the material created is of weapon-quality; a swordmaker with this spell could cast the spell and create a finely-crafted, high-quality sword in 12 turns (two hours) or less.

Following the same general guidelines as *ironform*, a steel wall will have an AC of -10(2) and about 20 hit points per 1" thickness.

### Symbol

Range: Touch

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Creates one magical rune

This spell creates a written magical drawing (a "rune") of great power. There are six kinds of symbols; the caster must select one when the spell is memorized. The rune may be placed on an object (such as a door or wall) or placed in mid-air. The rune cannot move; if placed on a creature or moving object, it will remain at that point when the surface moves (possibly floating in mid-air).

When any living creature passes over or through the rune, or touches the object on which the rune is inscribed, or (foolishly) reads the rune, the rune's effect takes place immediately (no saving throw).

There is one exception: a magic-user, and any other creature which can normally cast magic-

user spells (high-level thieves with scrolls do not count!), may make a saving throw vs. spells *if* he merely reads or touches (rather than passes) the symbol. If the saving throw is successful, the symbol has no effect.

All symbols look similar to normal writings. Six symbols and their effects are given below; the DM may create others (such as *polymorph*, *teleport*, *charm*, *geas*, etc.).

**Death:** Slays any creature with 75 hit points or less; does not affect a creature with 76 hit points or more.

**Discord:** The victim attacks allies (if any) or is otherwise *confused* (as the 4th level *confusion* spell). The effect is permanent until removed by a *dispel magic* spell (at normal chances for success) or by a cleric's *curse all* spell.

**Fear:** The victim immediately runs away from the symbol, at his Running Speed, for 30 rounds (as the wand).

**Insanity:** The victim becomes insane, and cannot attack, cast spells, or use special abilities or items. The victim may walk, but must be carefully tended or may run away. This effect is permanent until removed by a *dispel magic* spell (at normal chances for success) or by a cleric's *curse all* spell.

**Sleep:** The victim falls asleep, and cannot be awakened. The victim will wake normally in 1d10 + 10 (11-20) hours or if *dispel magic* is used to negate it (at normal chances for success).

**Stunning:** Affects any creature with 150 or fewer hit points. The victim is stunned for 2d6 turns (as the *power word stun* spell).

### Travel

Range: 0 (caster only)

Duration: One turn per level of the caster

Effect: Allows aerial or gaseous travel

This spell allows the magic-user to move quickly and freely, even between the planes of existence. The caster (only) may *fly* in the same manner as given by the magic-user's spell, at a rate of 360' (120'). The caster can also enter a nearby plane of existence, simply by concentrating for one round. He may enter a maximum of one plane per turn.

The magic-user may bring one other creature for every five levels of experience (rounded down; for example, a 28th level magic-user could bring five other creatures on the journey). To bring others, he must touch them, or they must touch him, while the spell is cast and the shift is made. Any unwilling creature can make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. The caster must take the others with him—he cannot send them while remaining behind.

While this spell is in effect, the magic-user (only) may assume *gaseous form* by concentrating for one full round. (If he is interrupted, no change occurs.) Unlike the potion effect, all equipment carried also becomes part of the same *gaseous cloud*. In this form, the caster may travel at double the normal flying rate: 720' (240'). While *gaseous*, the magic-user cannot use items or cast spells, but also cannot be damaged except by magic (weapons or certain spells). Also, a *gaseous* being cannot pass through a *protection from evil* spell effect or an *anti-magic shell*.

## Ninth Level Magical Spells

### Contingency

Range: Touch

Duration: Indefinite (see below)

Effect: Prepares one other spell

This powerful spell acts as a trigger for one stated magic-user spell; this second spell must be of 4th level or less that does not normally cause damage.

While casting a *contingency* spell, the magic-user must describe one situation and the spell which is contingent upon it. When that situation next occurs, the contingent spell effect triggers automatically and immediately, as if cast at that time.

Examples of proper use:

"When I am touched or struck by any living creature that is not a Lawful or Neutral cleric, except for my friends Charlie McGonigle and Sally Silvermose (contingency), then cast *charm monster* on the creature touching or striking me (spell)."

"When I have eight hit points or less and am about to be damaged (contingency), then cast *dimension door* on myself to take me to a destination one inch above ground level directly upward; or, if that is greater than 360° away, to the furthest unoccupied area within range that I have seen within the 12 hour period prior to the existence of this contingency (spell effect)."

No item or creature can have more than one *contingency* spell cast on it; not even a *wish* can allow multiple applications. The *contingency* described can be as detailed or as simple as desired, but is somewhat limited in effect: It must pertain to something within 120° of the triggering event. A contingency based on a far-off occurrence is beyond the spell's capacity. The target and effect of the secondary spell must always be specified, and if any necessary details are lacking, the secondary spell does not occur.

A *contingency* spell effect has no maximum duration. It may remain for centuries before the situation described comes to pass.

### Create Any Monster

Range: 90'

Duration: 3 turns

Effect: Creates one or more monsters

This spell is similar to the 7th level spell create *normal monsters* and the 8th level spell create *magical monsters*, but with fewer limitations on the types of creatures appearing.

The range and duration are triple those of the 7th level version. The spell cannot create humans and demihumans, but can create any other creature, regardless of the number of special abilities (asterisks). However, if the caster wants to create a creature with three or more asterisks, the caster must have carefully studied one (either alive or dead) for at least one hour to be able to create another with this spell. As with the lesser spells, the maximum number of Hit Dice of creatures is equal to the level of the caster.

To create a *construct* (as described in Chapter 14), the caster must obtain the proper materials necessary to create the construct. The spell will create only one construct, regardless of the caster's Hit Dice; but it is permanent, and does not

vanish at the end of the spell duration. (However, a *dispel magic* spell, with normal chances of success, can destroy this type of construct.)

As with the 8th level spell, the cost of materials required to create a construct is a minimum of 5,000 gold pieces per asterisk (or more, depending on your campaign). If the construct has four or more asterisks (such as a drolem), the cost is doubled (or more; ask your DM). Chapter 16 contains more rules for enchanting magical items (including constructs), and has suggestions regarding nondispellable constructs.

*Created* monsters of all types can be blocked by a *protection from evil* or *anti-magic shell* spell effect.

### Gate\*

Range: 30'

Duration: 10' x 10(1-10) turns or 1 turn

Effect: Opens a portal to another plane

When the magic-user casts this spell, he must name one target: the Ethereal Plane, the Astral Plane, one of the four elemental planes, or one outer plane. He must also name a resident of that plane, usually that of an Immortal, a ruler of the plane. The spell opens a direct connection to the other plane of existence.

A *gate* to an outer plane remains open for only one turn. Any other *gate* remains open for 10' x 10 (1-100) turns, and there is a 10% chance per turn that some other-planar creature will wander through the *gate* while it is open.

A *gate* to an elemental plane actually creates a vortex and a *wormhole*, and a *wish* may be used to make them permanent. Planes, vortexes, and wormholes are described in Chapter 18.

Contact with an outer plane is dangerous, and the magic-user must know and speak the name of the Immortal he wishes to contact. The Immortal he calls will probably (95% chance) arrive in 1d6 rounds, but there is a 5% chance that some other being from the outer planes will respond. When the being arrives, it immediately looks for the spellcaster.

If the caster does not have an excellent reason for opening the *gate*, the being will probably destroy the caster. Even if the caster provides an excellent reason, the being may merely leave immediately, showing no interest. If the reason is of supreme importance to the magic-user and of some interest to the being (DM's discretion), it may actually help for a short time.

The reverse of this spell, *close gate*, will close a gate created by normal form of the spell. It can also be used to close a permanent *gate* to a nearby plane (such as an elemental vortex). But the spell cannot affect an Immortal; it cannot, for instance, make him leave if he chooses to stay.

### Heal

Range: Touch (one creature)

Duration: Permanent

Effect: Cures anything

This spell's effect is identical to that of the 6th level cleric spell *curaeall*. When used to cure wounds, it cures nearly all of the damage, leaving only 1d6 points of damage remaining. It can instead remove a curse, neutralize a poison, cure a disease, cure blindness, or even remove a *feeblemind* effect.

### Immunity

Range: Touch (one creature)

Duration: One turn per level of the caster

Effect: Bestows immunity or resistance to some spells and weapons

This spell gives the recipient total immunity to all 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd level spells. Furthermore, 4th- and 5th level spells have only half normal effect, or one-quarter normal if the victim makes a successful saving throw. Any spell effect that is quantifiable is reduced in effect; these effects include reductions in duration, bonuses, penalties, damage, etc. Round fractions off in the recipient's favor.

The recipient is also completely immune to all missiles (normal or magical), as well as normal and silver weapons; he takes half damage from magical hand-held weapons. This applies only to weapons; claws, bites, breath weapons, and other natural attack forms are not blocked.

By concentrating, the recipient can drop the protection, allowing spells (such as *cure wounds*) to have normal effects for that round. If dropped, the *immunity* is absent for one round (including the protection from weapons), but returns automatically at the end of the round.

A carefully worded *wish* spell can extend this protection, giving immunity to 4th level spells and +1 weapons, and half normal effect from 5th and 6th level spells. No further improvements are possible.

### Maze

Range: 60'

Duration: See below (1d6 turns, 2d20 rounds, 2d4 rounds, or 1d4 rounds)

Effect: Traps one creature

This spell creates an indestructible maze in the Astral Plane and places one victim into the maze (he gets no saving throw). The intelligence of the victim determines the time he needs to escape the maze.

### Maze Duration

| <i>Victim's</i>     | <i>Time Required</i> |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| <i>Intelligence</i> | <i>To Escape</i>     |
| Non-toLow (1-8)     | 1d6 (1-6) turns      |
| Average (9-12)      | 2d20 (2-40) rounds   |
| High (13-17)        | 2d4 (2-8) rounds     |
| Genius (18+)        | 1d4 (1-4) rounds     |

When he escapes the *maze*, the victim returns to the exact place from which he originally disappeared.

### Meteor Swarm

Range: 240'

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Creates four or eight meteor-fireballs

This spell creates either 4 or 8 meteors (at the caster's choice). Each meteor can be aimed at a different target within range, but only one meteor can be aimed at any one creature. Each meteor slams into its target and explodes like a *fireball* (affecting all creatures within a 20' radius).

If the caster creates four meteors, each strikes for 8d6 (8-48) points of damage and then explodes for 8d6 (8-48) points of fire damage. If

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_59_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_59_Picture_2.jpeg)

the caster creates eight smaller meteors, each strikes for 4d6 (4-24) points and then explodes for 4d6 more points of fire damage. Note that if the meteors are aimed accurately, a victim or area might find itself within overlapping blasts and thus take explosion damage multiple times.

The player rolls damage for each strike and blast separately. A meteor never misses its target.

Any victim struck by a meteor takes full "strike" damage (no saving throw). Each victim within a blast radius may make a saving throw vs. spells to take only half of the given blast damage. Even fire-resistant and fire-using creatures are fully affected by *strikes* from a *meteor swarm*, although they might be resistant to the fiery explosions. A separate saving throw must be made for each blast the character contacts.

## Power Word Kill

Range: 120'

Duration: Instantaneous

Effect: Slays or stuns one or more creatures

This spell enables the caster to affect one or more victims within 120' (no saving throw). Exception: A magic-user, and any creature which can cast magic-user spells, may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid this effect, with a —4 penalty to the roll.

A single victim with 1-60 hit points is automatically slain; one with 61-100 hit points is *stunned* (as *power word stun*) and unable to act for 1d4 turns. No creature with 101 or more hit points is affected.

The spell can also be used to slay up to five victims if each has 20 hit points or less (again, no saving throw).

## Prismatic Wall

Range: 60'

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Creates a multi-colored barrier

This spell creates a barrier of many colors with a glittering appearance as if from light shining through a prism. This wall is 2" thick, with 1/8" between the colors. The effect must be either a sphere with a radius of 10', centered on the caster, or a flat surface (vertical or horizontal) of up to 500 square feet in area.

Whatever its form, the *prismatic wall* cannot be moved (even by a *wish*). The caster may pass through it freely and unharnessed, with any items he chooses to carry. All other creatures and objects contacting or passing through the *prismatic wall* are affected by its magic, starting with the first color they contact.

It takes powerful magic to break through the wall. A *wish* spell or a *rod of cancellation* will remove the three outermost remaining colors, but that's all.

To break through a *prismatic wall*, an attacker must attack it with a specific sequence of spells. Each spell will cancel one color of the *prismatic wall*. These remedy spells, shown on the chart below, must be cast in the correct order (first, any magical cold to remove the red layer; then, any magical lightning to remove the orange layer; and so on). When cast successfully, each spell causes the appropriate color to disappear from the wall. When all layers are gone, so is the wall.

A person with an active *anti-magic shell* (in-

cluding the caster of the *prismatic wall*) will not be able to pass through the wall, but the attempt will not damage either the *anti-magic shell* or the *prismatic wall*.

The *prismatic wall* extends into the nearest plane of existence (the Ethereal Plane, if cast on the Prime Plane), appearing there as an indestructible solid wall. Planar and dimensional travel can therefore not bypass it.

The colors and effects of a *prismatic wall* are always the same; when created, the violet side is always closest to the caster. The effects and colors of the *prismatic wall* are summarized below.

### Shapechange

Range: 0 (caster only)

Duration: One turn per level of the caster

Effect: Caster may change form

This spell is similar to the 4th level *polymorph self* spell, but is far more powerful. The caster actually becomes another creature or object in all respects except the mind, hit points, and saving throws. The caster takes his new armor class, attack rolls, special attack forms, immunities, and all other details from the form he has taken.

A magic-user cannot cast spells in any form except that of a bipedal humanoid (demihuman, goblin, ogre, giant, etc.). The caster cannot take a completely unique form (such as that of a specific character, Elemental Ruler, or Immortal). He can gain the likeness but not the abilities of another character class. When wearing another form, he can only cast spells from his own memory; he can't cast from scrolls or his spell book. He cannot assume huge inanimate forms; if he tries to, the form will be a maximum of one foot tall per experience level of the caster and 100 cn weight per level.

Except for these limits, the caster can become any creature or object that he or she has ever seen. He cannot change into imaginary or unfamiliar creatures; unless there are ten-armed trolls in your campaign, for example, he cannot turn into one. The caster may change shape at will during the spell's duration; each change requires a full round of concentration.

Note that the caster does assume the flaws of the new form as well as its strengths. If, for example, the caster is struck by a *sword* +2, +5 vs. *dragons* while in dragon form, the +5 bonus applies against his new form.

This spell effect cannot be made permanent and is subject to *dispel magic*. During the spell duration, the caster cannot pass through any *protection from evil* or *anti-magic shell* spell effect.

### Survival

Range: Touch

Duration: One hour per level of the caster

Effect: Protects one creature against all non-magical environmental damage

This spell protects the recipient from adverse conditions of all types, including normal heat or cold, lack of air, and so forth. While the spell is in effect, the caster needs no air, food, water, or sleep. The spell does not protect against magical damage of any type, attack damage, poisons, breath weapons, or physical blows from creatures. It does protect against all damage caused by natural conditions on other planes of existence.

For example, a cleric might use this spell: in a desert or blizzard to prevent damage from the natural conditions; underground or underwater, enabling survival without air; in space, to magically survive in vacuum; or on the elemental plane of Fire, to protect against conditional fire damage.

### Prismatic Wall Effects

| Color  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                        | Negated By            |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Red    | Blocks all magical missiles; inflicts 12 points of damage (no saving throw allowed)                                                                                           | Any magical cold      |
| Orange | Blocks all nonmagical missiles; inflicts 24 points of damage (no saving throw allowed)                                                                                        | Any magical lightning |
| Yellow | Blocks all breath weapons; inflicts 48 points of damage (no saving throw allowed)                                                                                             | Magic missile spell   |
| Green  | Blocks all detection spells (crystal balls, ESP, etc.); anyone touching it must make a saving throw vs. poison or die                                                         | Passwall spell        |
| Blue   | Blocks all poisons, gases, and gaze attacks; anyone touching it must make a saving throw vs. turn to stone or be petrified                                                    | Disintegrate spell    |
| Indigo | Blocks all matter; anyone touching it must make a saving throw vs. spells or be <i>gated</i> to a random outer plane, and possibly (50%) lost forever                         | Dispel magic spell    |
| Violet | Blocks magic of all types; anyone touching it must make a saving throw vs. wands or be struck unconscious and insane (curable only by a <i>curse</i> spell or a <i>wish</i> ) | Continual light spell |

## Timestop

Range: 0 (caster only)

Duration: 2-5 rounds

Effect: Allows caster to act for  $Id4 + 1$  (2-5) rounds while everything else "stops"

To the caster, this spell seems to stop time. It speeds the caster so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen at their Normal Speeds, in "normal time." From the caster's point of view, the effect lasts for  $Id4 + 1$  (2-5) rounds. The caster may perform one action during each of these magical rounds.

Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, etc. can still harm the caster. While the *timestop* is in effect, however, other creatures are invulnerable to the caster's attacks and spells. Spells with durations other than "instantaneous" may be created and left to take effect when time resumes. Note that *no time elapses* while this spell is in effect; durations of other spells cast start after the *timestop* ends.

The spellcaster cannot move items held by those in "normal time," but can move other items that are not "stuck," including those worn or carried by others. The caster is completely undetectable by those in "normal time." However, the magic-user cannot pass through a *protection from evil* or *anti-magic shell* while under this spell's effect.

## Wish

Range: Special

Duration: Special

Effect: Special

A *wish* is the single most powerful spell a magic-user can have. It is never found on a scroll, but may be placed elsewhere (in a ring, for example) in rare cases. Only magic-users of 36th level and with an 18 (or greater) Wisdom score may cast the *wish* spell.

 *wording the Wish:* The player must say or write the exact *wish* his character makes. The wording is very important. The *wish* will usually follow the literal wording, and whatever the intentions of the magic-user.

The DM should try to maintain game balance, being neither too generous nor too stingy in deciding the effects of a *wish*. Even a badly phrased *wish*, made with good intentions, may have good results. However, if the *wish* is greedy, or made with malicious intent, the DM should make every effort to distort the results of the spell so that the caster does not profit from it. If necessary, the DM can even disallow the *wish*; it would then have no effect. Whenever a *wish* fails or is misinterpreted, the DM should explain (after the game) the problem or flaw in the phrasing.

Here are some examples of faulty wishes:

"I wish that I knew everything about this dungeon" could result in the character knowing all for only a second, and then forgetting it.

"I wish for a million gold pieces" can be granted by having them land on the character (that's 100,000 pounds of gold!), and then vanish.

"I wish to immediately and permanently possess the gaze power of a basilisk while retaining all of my own abilities and items" is a carefully worded *wish* that's out of balance. Characters

able to use these high-level spells are already quite powerful. This *wish* could result in the character growing a basilisk head in addition to the character's own head.

A *wish* cannot be used to gain either experience points or levels of experience.

**Possible Effects:** A properly worded *wish* can substitute for any other magical spell of 8th level or less, or any clerical or druidic spell of 6th level or less, at the DM's discretion. This common use of a *wish* is more likely to succeed with little chance for error than other uses of the spell. Otherwise, if the *wish* is used to harm another creature, the victim may make a saving throw vs. spells. If the save is successful, the victim takes half the ill effects and the other half rebounds on *the caster* (who may also save to avoid it, but with a —4 penalty to the roll). If the *wish* will inconvenience someone without harming him (for example, by causing him to teleport into a prison cell), the victim gets no saving throw.

A character can use a *wish* to gain treasure, up to a maximum of 50,000 gold pieces per *wish*. However, the caster loses 1 experience point per gold piece value of treasure gained, and this loss cannot be magically restored.

The magic-user can use a *wish* to temporarily change any one ability score to a minimum of 3 or maximum of 18. This effect lasts for only six turns.

*Wishes* can also be used to permanently increase ability scores, but the cost is very high: You must cast as many *wishes* as the number of the ability score desired. All the *wishes* must be cast within a one-week period.

You may raise an ability score only one point at a time. To raise your Strength from 15 to 16 takes 16 wishes. To then raise it to 17 will take an additional 17 wishes. *Wishes* cannot permanently lower ability scores.

A *wish* cannot raise the maximum experience level for human characters; 36th level is an absolute limit. However, one *wish* can allow demi-humans to gain one additional Hit Die (for a new maximum of 9 for halflings, 11 for elves, and 13 for dwarves). This affects only hit points, and does not change any other scores (such as attack rolls, *elves'* number of spells, etc.).

A *wish* can change a demi-human to a human, or the reverse. Such a change is permanent, and the recipient does not become magical. Halflings and dwarves become fighters of the same level. Elves become magic-users or fighters (but not both), at the choice of the caster of the *wish*. The changed character would then gain levels of experience normally. A human changes to the same level demi-human, but no higher than the normal racial maximum.

If one character casts a *wish* to change another's character class, the victim (at his option) may make a saving throw vs. spells with a +5 bonus to resist the change.

A *wish* can sometimes change the results of a past occurrence. This is normally limited to events of the previous day. A lost battle may be won, or the losses may be made far less severe, but impossible odds cannot be overcome completely. A death could be changed to a near-death survival; a permanent loss could be made temporary. The DM may wish to advise players when their *wishes* exceed the limit of the spell's power (or his patience).

**Important Note:** Whenever an effect is described as being unchangeable "even with a *wish*," that statement supersedes all others here.

*Wishes* can cause great problems if not handled properly. The DM must see that *wishes* are reasonably limited or the balance and enjoyment of the game will be completely upset. The DM should not allow *wishes* that alter the basics of the game (such as a wish that dragons can't breathe for damage). The more unreasonable and greedy the *wish* is, the less likely that the *wish* will become reality.

# Chapter 4: Equipment

![Decorative icon representing a character throwing a weapon.]()![](_page_61_Picture_1.jpeg)

Characters who throw themselves into dangerous situations tend to survive a lot longer if they have the right tools and equipment for each situation. In this chapter, we list most of the normal equipment characters will need in a game.

## Money

Some quick notes on money in the D&D® game:

Starting Gold: Beginning characters receive a one-time sum of 3d6 x 10 gold pieces. This represents money saved up by the character before he embarked on his adventuring career, or money given to him by his family before he left home. It should be spent on weapons, armor, and equipment; the DM may have recommendations as to what the characters should buy. When first created, the character also can be assumed to own two or three sets of plain clothes, a pair of shoes, a belt, and a belt-pouch.

Abbreviations: The game commonly uses the following abbreviations.

platinum pieces = pp

gold pieces = gp

electrum pieces = ep

silver pieces = sp

copper pieces = cp

Conversions: You can convert money from one type to another using the following values.

1 sp = 10 cp

1 ep = 5 sp = 50 cp

1 gp = 2 ep = 10 sp = 100 cp

1 pp = 5 gp = 10 ep = 50 sp = 500 cp

## Weapons

Most characters will want to carry one or more reliable weapons. The Weapons Table shows the weapons available in the D&D game. Some of these weapons have special effects that are Some of the weapons in the table will look very similar to one another. But these weapons often demonstrate substantial differences if you also use the optional weapon mastery rules described in the next chapter.

Weapon information in the table is defined as follows:

- Item gives the weapon's name.
- Damage shows the amount of damage the weapon does; if the column shows "1d6," for instance, you'd roll 1d6, for a result of 1 to 6 points of damage whenever you hit with that weapon.
- Range shows the range characteristics of the weapon if it fires projectiles or can be thrown. A number like "60/120/180," for example, means that the weapon is at short range (for the indicated +1 to attack roll modifier) from 1' to 60'; it is at medium range (for no attack roll modifier) from 61' to 120'; and it is at long range (for a -1 to attack roll modifier) from 121' to 180'. Beyond 180', it cannot hit a target. These distances are measured as feet indoors and as yards outdoors; for example, a crossbow that can fire 180' inside a dungeon can launch its quarrel 180 yards outside.
- Cost (gp) shows how much it costs to buy the weapon in gold pieces (gp).

Weapons Table (Notes)a The weapon's normal load of ammunition is already included in the weapon's encumbrance (bow: 20 arrows; crossbow: 30 quarrels; sling: 30 stones; blowgun: 5 darts). If you want to vary the number of missiles you carry with the missile weapon, 2 arrows equal 1 cn in encumbrance, 3 quarrels equal 1 cn, 5 sling stones equal 1 cn, and 5 darts equal 1 cn. Therefore, a long bow without arrows has an encumbrance of 20 cn; a light crossbow without quarrels has an encumbrance of 40 cn.

c Clerics may use this weapon. Druids may, too, if they can find a form of this weapon with no metal or stone parts.

m Missile weapon; never used as a melee weapon.

n A net's cost and encumbrance are based on its size. Nets cost 1 sp per square foot of surface area and have an encumbrance of 1 cn per square foot. A Medium net ( $6' \times 6'$ ) would cost 36 sp (3.6 gp) and have an encumbrance of 36 cn.

r This weapon can be thrown, but is only rarely used this way; only characters at the Expert or greater level of weapon mastery can throw this weapon in combat.

s This weapon has special features; read the weapon description.

t This is a hand weapon that may also be thrown.

v This weapon may be set vs. a charge.

w Magic-users may use this weapon at the DM's discretion.

HH This weapon can be used either one-handed or two-handed. Used two-handed, it operates similarly to two-handed weapons (i.e., the wielder cannot use a shield when using the weapon this way). However, a character using this weapon, even in its two-handed style, does not automatically lose individual initiative. Halfings and other small races can use this weapon.

2H This weapon requires two hands for use. The wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halfings and small races cannot use this weapon.

S Small weapon.

M Medium weapon.

L Large weapon.

\* Enc (cn) shows how much encumbrance the weapon has, measured in coin-weights (cn). One coin weighs one-tenth of a pound. Remember that the more encumbrance a character is carrying, the slower he moves.

\* Notes refer you to the description section that describes weapon characteristics. Sometimes a weapon that looks unimpressive on the chart will have special features listed in the Notes column, and those special features might make them very useful weapons indeed.

AmmunitionMissile weapons such as bows eventually run out of ammunition; here's what it costs to buy additional ammunition.

These figures apply for any type of weapon that goes by the name shown. Arrows cost the same, come in the same standard loads, and have the same encumbrance for a short bow as for a long bow; darts for a short blowgun are identical to those for a long blowgun.

Silver-tipped arrows and quarrels are like ordi-

nary missiles, except that their arrowheads are made of silver, which is useful when fighting certain monsters. Such arrows are comparatively expensive and are usually sold by the arrow, rather than in batches of 20 or 30. Likewise, silver pellets are made for slings.

Arrow and quarrel costs include the price of a cheap quiver or case, both of which carry a standard load of ammunition.

Weapon DescriptionsThe weapons from the Weapons Table are described here. They are listed in alphabetical order for convenience.

Axe, Battle: This is a large one- or two-bladed chopping head fixed upon a long ( $3' \text{--} 5'$ ) wooden shaft. This is a two-handed weapon; the wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halfings and small non-humans such as goblins *cannot* use this weapon.

Axe, Hand: This is a small chopping blade (usually only one blade) affixed to a small ( $1' \text{--} 2'$ ) wooden shaft. It is a one-handed weapon and may be thrown.

Bastard Sword: See Sword, Bastard (below).

Battle Axe: See Axe, Battle (above).

Blackjack: This weapon is a small leather sack,  $4' \text{--} 8'$  long, filled with sand or metal shot and with a looped strap attached. It causes little damage (1d2 points) but, if it is used to strike a victim's head or neck, it can possibly stun or cause unconsciousness.

This weapon has no effect on a victim wearing a metal helmet (which is included in any set of plate, banded, chain, or scale mail) or on any unarmed monster of armor class 0 or less (which indicates very tough skin or protective plating).

The DM decides whether or not someone using a blackjack can hit his target's head. The DM might decide, for example, that someone who has sneaked up on a completely unsuspecting target can aim at the target's head with no penalty, or that the character, in combat, can aim at the enemy's head by taking a -4 penalty to the attack roll. Also at the DM's discretion, if the target is so much taller than the attacker that the attacker can't reach his head, then the attack can only inflict normal damage.

If the attack does hit the target's head, consult the Weapon Special Effects Table. The victim must make a saving throw vs. death ray (possibly with a bonus; see the table). If he fails the saving throw, he suffers the additional effects shown on the table, as determined by his Hit Dice. These effects are as follows:

**Knockout:** The victim is immediately unconscious and remains helpless for d100 (d%) rounds.

**Stun:** The victim is *stunned* and will remain stunned until he successfully makes a saving throw vs. death ray. He may try to make a new saving throw each round.

**Delay:** The victim is mildly dazed; he loses initiative on the next round.

**Blowgun:** This weapon is a tube, 6"-4" long. The user places a small dart or thorn into it, aims the tube at a target, and blows air into it—forcing the dart to fly toward the target.

The darts cause no damage themselves. However, the darts are usually treated with poison. A blowgun dart merely scratches the victim, with little penetration; it inflicts no real damage. If hit, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or suffer the effects. Depending on the size or level of experience of the victim, he may gain a bonus to the saving throw (see the Weapon Special Effects Table). No undead creature or any creature immune to poison can be harmed by a blowgun.

The use of deadly poison as a weapon is not a good act. Because of its dangers, poison may be declared illegal by local or regional rulers. In this case, Lawful characters do not typically use it. The DM may choose not to allow player characters to use poisons in his campaign. Warn players that, if they want their characters to use blowguns, monsters will have them as well.

Longer blowguns are two-handed weapons; the wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halflings and small nonhumans such as goblins *cannot* use this weapon.

**Bola:** This weapon is a cord with weighted balls on the ends. It is whirled around and thrown at a victim. It causes very little damage itself (1d2 points), but may entangle, slow, or delay the victim.

If the attack roll is a 20 (not counting any modifiers), the victim must make a saving throw vs. death ray or be immediately paralyzed; he will die in  $1d6 + 2$  (3-8) rounds from strangling unless rescued. If freed, the victim remains effectively paralyzed for 2d6 (2-12) rounds. Creatures that do not breathe (such as constructs) are immune to this effect.

If the attack roll is successful but not a 20, the victim must make a saving throw vs. death ray, possibly with a bonus (see the Weapon Special Effects Table). If the saving throw is successful, the attack has no effect except damage. If the victim fails the saving throw, the result varies by the victim's experience level or size (see the Weapon Special Effects Table).

The victim may try to make a new saving throw during the hand-to-hand combat phase of each round until one is successful; this indicates that the victim has removed the bola. If another character tries to remove the bola that has struck a victim, the victim rolls his own saving throw vs. death ray, with a +2 bonus. When the victim makes the saving throw, the bola is removed. The victim may spend 1 round destroying the bola if he has an edged weapon and chooses to destroy it. Otherwise, the bola is undamaged; he can hold on to it or drop it.

Possible bola effects, as listed on the Weapon Special Effects Table, are as follows:

**Entangle:** The victim cannot attack, cast spells, or move until his saving throw is successfully made.

**Slow:** The victim is *slowed*, moving and attacking at half his normal rate; he cannot cast spells.

**Delay:** The victim automatically loses individual initiative for the next round.

This weapon can only affect solid creatures. Wraiths, spectres, ethereal creatures, and monsters made of water (such as a water elemental) cannot be affected.

Bolas are awkward to carry and may become tangled. For each additional bola carried, the encumbrance of the bolas triples: 1 bola = 5 en, 2 bolas = 15 en, 3 bolas = 45 en, etc.

**Bow, Long:** This is a piece of wood bent into a curve, with a taut string holding it in that position; it is used to launch arrows.

This bow is a two-handed weapon; the wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halflings and small races such as goblins *cannot* use this weapon.

**Bow, Short:** This bow is similar to the long bow, but it is smaller and not able to fire arrows as far. It, too, is a two-handed weapon, but it can be used by halfing characters and small races such as goblins.

**Cestus:** The cestus (plural: cest) is a sort of glove or thong wrapped around the hand; it has rough, cutting edges on the back, so that a punching attack will inflict more damage on an opponent. If the campaign uses the optional rules for two-weapons use, a character does not suffer the —4 penalty for the cestus worn on his offhand.

**Club:** This is a simple, blunt piece of wood used to batter opponents.

**Crossbow, Heavy:** This is a missile weapon consisting of a tough bow (like a small bow, but smaller and sometimes made of metal) laid crosswise across a stock with a trigger. It fires stubby arrows called quarrels.

Heavy crossbows are bulky, requiring two hands to use, and are slow to reload. A character with 18 strength can draw back the string with one hand and fire every round, but weaker characters must point the crossbow nose-down on the ground, brace it with one foot, and draw back the string with both hands in order to reload it; they can only fire it once every two rounds.

This crossbow is a two-handed weapon; the wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halflings and small nonhumans such as goblins *cannot* use this weapon.

**Crossbow, Light:** This weapon is similar to the heavy crossbow, but smaller. It also requires two hands to load, but only one to fire.

This crossbow is a two-handed weapon; the wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halfling characters and small races such as goblins *cannot* use this weapon.

**Dagger:** This is a small blade with a one-handed grip. It may be used in hand-to-hand combat or thrown. Some expensive varieties are made out of silver for use against certain magical creatures.

**Halberd:** See Polearms, Halberd (below).

**Hammer, Throwing:** This is a short-shafted, broad-headed hammer, capable of crushing blows. It is balanced for throwing.

**Hammer, War:** This weapon consists of a broad hammer head—sometimes with two striking ends instead of just one—on a medium-length (about 3') wooden shaft.

**Hand Axe:** See Axe, Hand (above).

**Heavy Crossbow:** See Crossbow, Heavy (above).

**Holy Water:** This is water that has been prepared by a special cleric (who must be at least 9th level or above). It is normally placed into a breakable bottle or gourd and then hurled at a target; if it strikes the target, the container smashes and the target is splashed.

Holy water only does the listed damage to undead monsters; all other characters and monsters are unaffected by it (except for being dampened).

If you are using the optional Weapon Mastery rules (in the next chapter), all characters have Basic mastery level when using holy water.

**Horned Shield:** See Shield Weapons, Horned Shield (below).

**Javelin:** This weapon is a thrusting point atop a light, long (4'-6') pole. Characters can throw it at targets or use it in hand-to-hand combat; in hand-to-hand, they can use it with one hand, keeping the other hand free for a shield or weapon. Halflings (and small races such as goblins) can use this weapon.

**Knife Shield:** See Shield Weapons, Knife Shield (below).

**Lance:** When in combat on horseback, many fighters use a special long spear called a lance. Fighters, dwarves, and elves can use the Lance Attack maneuver (see Chapter 8). Mystics can use lances, though they do not have the Lance Attack maneuver; even when on the back of a charging horse, mystics always thrust with the weapon as though fighting with a spear. Other human classes cannot use a lance effectively.

A character with a lance may still use a shield; however, if you are using the optional Weapon Mastery rules (in the next chapter), a character who is at Basic mastery with the lance cannot yet use a shield. Under the Weapon Mastery rules, a lance can be used to gain a defense bonus, but each round a lance is used to defend, it causes only half damage.

If the wielder of the lance has the Multiple Attacks option, he can indeed make multiple attacks, but not all against the same foe. He must ! make each attack against a different target, taking them in the course of his lance charge.

A lance used from the back of a flying mount can be used normally. If the wielder needs to release the lance and ties it to his saddle so that it ! will not drop to the ground, he cannot defend it with it.

**Light Crossbow:** See Crossbow, Light (above).

**Long Bow:** See Bow, Long (above).

**Mace:** This is a heavy striking head attached to a short- or medium-length wooden shaft.

**Net:** A net is an open mesh of rope or cord. Small nets (up to  $10' \times 10'$ ) are commonly used in hunting and adventuring and can be used as either a hand-to-hand or thrown weapon. The net's encumbrance varies by the size.

This weapon is commonly available in most campaign worlds. Its cost is low, but it is easily damaged. The net is one of humankind's first tools, having been invented in prehistoric times, and it is used by most humanoid monsters for both hunting and defense.

A net can only affect creatures made of solid material. Wraiths, spectres, ethereal creatures, and monsters made of water (such as water elements) cannot be affected.

A net inflicts no damage on the victim, but may entangle, slow, or delay the victim. The wielder makes a normal roll to hit his target; if he does, the target must make a saving throw vs. death ray, possibly with a bonus (see the Weapon Special Effects Table).

If the saving throw succeeds, the net does not affect the target; it drops off him without impairing him at all. If the victim fails his saving throw, the result varies by the victim's experience level or size.

Once a target is trapped in a net, he may make a new saving throw during the hand-to-hand combat phase of each round until one is successful; a successful roll indicates that the net has been pulled off and thrown aside. If he has a dagger (but not a longer weapon or a nonbladed weapon) in his hand when he is hit with the net, he has a +4 to his saving throw; success means that he has cut his way out of the net, thus destroying it.

#### Net's Table

| Victim's Size | Equivalent* | Net Size** |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Very small    | Up to 1'    | 2'X2'      |
| Small         | 1'+1'-3'    | 4'X4'      |
| Medium        | 3'+1'-6'    | 6'X6'      |
| Large         | 6'+1'-10'   | 9'X9'      |
| Very large    | 10'+1'-15'  | 12'X12'    |
| Huge          | 15'+2-20'   | 16'X16'    |
| Mammoth       | 20'+3-30'   | 25'X25'    |

\* A small net is right for a target the size of a halfling; a medium net is right for human, dwarf, and elf targets.

\*\* Or equivalent in square feet.

Magical nets are rare. The few that exist cannot be damaged except by fire or acid; daggers will not cut through them. An entangled victim can only remove the net, not damage it.

The effects listed on the Weapon Special Effects Table are as follows:

**Entangle:** The victim cannot attack, cast spells, or move until a saving throw is successful.

**Slow:** The victim is *slowed*, moving and attacking at half his normal rate. He cannot cast spells.

**Delay:** The victim automatically loses initiative for the next round.

A net can easily be damaged by any edged weapon (or claw or bite), but it can be repaired if rope or cord is available, which requires 1d3 turns of undisturbed repair work. A damaged net is useless.

Nets come in a variety of sizes; if the target is too large for the net, he will gain bonuses to his saving throw to avoid the effects. Using the Nets Table, determine how many sizes the victim is larger than the net. For each size greater, the victim gains a +4 bonus. A roll of 1 is always a failure unless the bonus is +20 or greater.

Nets 6' x 6' or smaller may be used one-handed. Larger nets require two hands and suffer the same penalties as other two-handed weapons. The wielder may not use a shield, always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon; and halflings and small nonhumans (such as goblins) cannot use nets larger than 6' x 6'.

**Normal Sword:** See Sword, Normal (below).

**Oil, Burning:** This type of weapon usually consists of cooking or lamp oil poured into a breakable container (such as a bottle, gourd, or glass lamp), with a fuse or wick attached. In combat, the wielder lights the fuse or wick and throws it at his target (lighting and throwing only takes one round if the character has another lit object handy). If the container hits the target, it bursts, splashes the target with the oil, and ignites the oil on target.

Burning oil causes 1d8 points of damage each round a target is in the fire. Oil that has been lit and thrown will burn for 2 rounds. If you are using the optional Weapon Mastery rules (next chapter), all characters are considered to have Basic mastery level with thrown containers of burning oil.

**Pike:** See Polearms, Pike (below).

**Polearms:** Polearms consist of various weapon blades mounted on long poles. Polearms may be used only by fighters, dwarves, elves, and mystics. Because of a polearm's length, a character with a polearm may attack a foe even when there is another friend or foe between them. Often, polearm wielders stand in the second rank of the combat, striking over the heads of their front-line comrades to hit front-line fighters of the enemy force.

A polearm may be used with the Fighter Combat options. However, the optional disarm rule may only be used where noted with the weapon type.

The polearm user's attack rolls suffer penalties of —3 for each of the following cases:

- The user is a dwarf.
- The wielder is attacking from behind a larger ally.
- An ally in front of the user is using a two-handed weapon (other than a polearm) or any weapon that is swung backward behind the wielder (e.g., a battle axe, bola, sling, etc.), thus endangering the polearm bearer.

If you are using the Weapon Mastery rules from the next chapter, characters trained in the use of these two-handed weapons can deflect attacks with them.

Four types of pole arms are shown on the

**Weapons Table:** They have individual entries because each has certain characteristics that distinguish it from the others when using the Weapon Mastery rules. The variations are as follows:

**Halberd:** This weapon is both a thrusting and a chopping weapon. It has a broad axehead with a spike on the top and a hook on the back.

**Pike:** This thrusting weapon (essentially an extra-long spear) has a short, sharp spearhead on the end of a very long pole (12-18').

**Poleaxe:** This chopping weapon has a small axehead attached to a pole of varying length (5-15'). It is essentially an extra-long battle axe.

**Polearm:** All other polearms use this line on the Weapons Table. A character using a polearm can say that it is a generic polearm, or he can say that he is using one of the following specific types of real-world polearms:

- **Bardiche:** This weapon has a heavy axe blade with a long spike projecting forward.

- **Bill:** A lightweight weapon, the bill has a long, narrow, single-edged blade (like a scythe).

- **Gisarme:** This weapon resembles a bill with a thin spike on the back of the blade, curving forward.

- **Glave:** This weapon has a broad, knife-like blade.

- **Lochaber Axe:** This weapon has a long, heavy, single-bladed axe with a hook on the back, pointing forward.

- **Partizan:** The partizan has a broad spearhead with two hooks at the base, pointing forward.

- **Ranseur:** This weapon has a short, sharp spike flanked by two short, curved blades at its base.

- **Sputum:** The sputum has a long spike with two sharp curved blades forming a trident shape.

- **Spontoon:** The spontoon has an elaborate blade, possibly wavy or with flares.

- **Voulge:** The voulige has a large, heavy, broad blade like a cleaver.

In the campaign, a DM can simply use the generic polearm entry on the Weapons Table for polearm variants. Or, if he's using the Weapon Mastery rules, he can follow the guidelines in that chapter for combining the traits of halberds, pikes, and polearms into new weapons.

Regardless of type, all polearms are two-handed weapons; the wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halflings and small nonhumans (such as goblins) cannot use this weapon.

**Poleaxe:** See Polearms, Poleaxe (above).

**Rock, Thrown:** This is a rock of fist size or smaller. When a character throws any object that causes impact damage, treat it as if it were a thrown rock; the DM can reduce the damage done if he thinks it is not as punishing as a normal rock. Strength modifications apply to attack rolls and damage.

If you are using the optional Weapon Mastery rules, all characters are considered to have Basic mastery level with thrown rocks.

**Shield Weapons:** These weapons combine a shield with weapon blades. Though awkward and prone to breaking, a shield weapon can provide a second attack when used with a one-

handed weapon. Only fighters, thieves, and demihumans may use these weapons. Monsters rarely use shield weapons.

The larger shield weapons may break during battle. Check for breakage whenever the attacker or the defender rolls the exact attack roll needed. (For example, if a roll of 9 or better is needed to hit and a 9 is rolled on the die, check for breakage.) Each time a breakage occurs, one of the shield weapon's blades becomes unusable.

The chance that a shield weapon will break is 5 or less on 1d10. Magical shield bonuses add to the die roll, and magical weapon bonuses of the foe subtract from it. In addition to magical modifiers, modify the foe's attack roll by -1 per 10 points of maximum damage possible.

For example, a fighter with a sword shield +3 is attacked by a monster using a two-handed sword. The monster needs a 7 to hit his target (before any modifications), and he rolls a 7 on the die. The wielder of the sword shield must check for breakage.

The shield wielder's base roll is 1d10; on a 5 or less his shield breaks. His roll will have a -1 penalty because his opponent's two-handed sword can do up to 10 points of damage. But he will have a bonus of +3 because his shield is magical. He rolls a 6, which yields  $6 - 1 + 3 = 8$ . His shield doesn't break.

The four types of shield weapons are as follows:

**Horned Shield:** A one-foot circular shield that is strapped to the arm rather than held. A single spike projects from its center. This shield is very durable and will not break.

**Knife Shield:** A small buckler equipped with one or two short blades protruding from its sides.

**Sword Shield:** A medium-size shield with one or two sword or spear blades projecting from the sides (if round) or ends (if oblong).

**Tusked Shield:** A large shield with one to four short blades protruding from the sides. It may have a central spike. Due to its size, the tusked shield requires two hands to use and may not be used with an additional weapon or another shield. Characters using this weapon always lose individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halfflings and small non-humans such as goblins cannot use this weapon.

Short Bow: See Bow, Short (above).

Short Sword: See Sword, Short (below).

**Sling:** This is a length of cord or a long leather strap with a pouch in the middle. The user places a stone or metal "bullet" in the pouch, holds the sling by the ends, whirls it to build up speed, and then releases one end of the strap to launch the missile at his target.

**Spear:** The spear is a thrusting head attached to one end of a medium-to-long pole (6'-8'). Fighters, dwarves, elves, and mystics can use the set spear vs. charge maneuver (see Chapter 8).

**Staff:** This is a 2"-thick staff, 4'-6" long, possibly with iron-loaded ends. A staff may be used by all classes, even by magic-users if the DM so permits.

The staff is a two-handed weapon; the wielder

of the weapon may not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halfflings and small non-humans cannot use this weapon.

Stone: See Rock, Thrown (above).

**Sword, Bastard:** This popular weapon is similar to a normal sword (below) but has a longer blade and a hilt (handle) nearly as long as that of a two-handed sword; the overall weapon length may be from  $3 1/2$  to  $4 1/2$ . The sword may be wielded either one- or two-handed.

A character cannot use a shield while using this item two-handed. However, it does not cause the loss of individual initiative. The bastard sword cannot be used by a halfing or other small humanoid.

**Sword, Normal:** This is the classic weapon of fantasy. It consists of a one-handed hilt (handle) attached to a long cutting or thrusting blade; the weapon is usually between  $2' 1/2$  to  $3' 1/2$  long.

**Sword, Short:** This is much like the normal sword (above) but smaller; it is usually between  $2' 2 1/2$  long. Halfflings and small nonhumans such as goblins can use this weapon.

**Sword, Two-Handed:** This weapon, also called the great sword, is the largest type of sword. It is similar to the normal sword (above) but much longer, usually being  $4 1/2$  to  $6 1/2$  long.

This sword is a two-handed weapon; the wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halfflings and small nonhumans such as goblins cannot use this weapon.

**Sword Shield:** See Shield Weapons, Sword Shield (above).

**Throwing Hammer:** See Hammer, Throwing (above).

**Torch:** A torch is basically a flaming club. Although lighter than a club, it is on fire so it does the same amount of damage as a club (1d4). If someone uses an *unlit* torch as a bludgeoning weapon, it does 1d2 points of damage.

If you use the optional Weapon Mastery rules, mastery with a club is also mastery with a torch. However (also from the Weapon Mastery rules), someone unskilled with a torch does not halve damage, but always inflicts 1d4 points (regardless if the torch is lit).

**Trident:** This is a light spear with three barbed prongs on the end, designed for underwater use. Any small creatures ( $2'$  long or less, such as normal fish) hit by a trident become stuck on the spiked prongs. To free themselves, they need to make an ability check vs. Strength to free themselves. They may make one attempt per round; many small creatures have Strengths that do not exceed 1 or 2.

This weapon can be used either one- or two-handed. Used two-handed, it operates similarly to other two-handed weapons (i.e., the wielder cannot use a shield when using the weapon this way). However, a character using this weapon,

even in its two-handed style, does not lose his initiative roll, and halfflings and other small creatures can use this weapon.

**Tusked Shield:** See Shield Weapons, Tusked Shield (above).

**Two-Handed Sword:** See Sword, Two-Handed (above).

**War Hammer:** See Hammer, War (above).

**Whip:** This weapon is a long, braided leather strap with a handle. It may be from  $5' 30''$  long. It is a hand-to-hand weapon and may be used to either cause damage (1d2 points) or to entangle. Before each combat round, the user must declare which option is being used. Whichever he uses, he makes a normal attack roll.

If he scores a hit, the whip either inflicts 1d2 points of damage or (if entangling) is attempted) forces the victim to make a saving throw vs. death ray, possibly with a bonus. (See the Weapon Special Effects Table for his saving throw bonus and the result of the attack.) If the victim fails his saving throw, he may be entangled, slowed, or delayed.

The effects listed on the Weapon Special Effects Table are as follows:

**Entangle:** The victim cannot attack, cast spells, or move until a saving throw is successful.

**Slow:** The victim is *slowed*, moving and attacking at half his normal rate. He cannot cast spells.

**Delay:** The victim automatically loses initiative for the next round.

This weapon is not very useful except as a tactical device. It is most often used by a thief or other character who wants to help a front-line fighter somehow while not actually engaging in melee.

A whip can only entangle creatures made of solid material. Wraiths, spectres, ethereal creatures, and monsters made of water (such as water elements) cannot be entangled. They will, however, suffer the normal damage caused by a whip. (A normal whip will not hit a monster that can only be hit by magical weapons, of course; that would require a magical whip.)

## Nonstandard Weapon Use (Optional)

Sometimes a character may want to use a one-handed weapon with two hands. This inflicts more damage, but has the following limitations:

- Any one-handed weapon (except "Other Weapons") can be used for this option.
- The character loses individual initiative.
- The character cannot effectively use a shield for defense while wielding a weapon two-handed (no AC bonus).

When used two-handed, weapons gain an additional +1 point of damage to their attacks. This bonus applies to any one-handed weapons used with both hands, regardless of the original damage of the weapon. Therefore, a dagger used in this way inflicts 1d4 + 1 (2-5) points of damage, and a spear does 1d6 + 1 (2-7) points of damage when wielded with both hands.

## Armor

All fighters, clerics, dwarves, elves, and half-lings can use any of the types of armor described below. Thieves and druids can use the types of armor indicated in the "Notes" column. Magic-users and mystics can use none of these armor types.

Armor is normally made for a specific race. The DM can impose penalties on a character who wears the armor of a different race. For example, an elf would find a dwarf's chain mail awkward and heavy (for an additional reduction to movement beyond what the armor's encumbrance calls for), a halfing would find it very hard to move in a human's armor (he would have to save vs. paralysis each round to avoid tripping and falling down), and a dwarf couldn't get into a halfing's armor at all!

### Armor Descriptions

Each type of armor constitutes a full set. The player can presume that his character, as part of the set of armor, gets the type of headgear appropriate to the armor (e.g., from a stout leather cap to a full metal helm). The player may imagine other appropriate armor components as he chooses—gauntlets, vambraces, greaves, etc.—as these components do not affect play or armor class.

The armor listed in the Armor Table is described here and is presented alphabetically for your convenience.

Banded Mail: This is a suit of heavy leather armor with strips or knobs of metal imbedded in

\* Subtract 1 from AC if a shield is used.

D A druid can use this type of armor if it contains no metal parts or other nonorganic components (parts that have never been alive).

S Suit armor has some very special characteristics; carefully read the description of this type of armor.

T A thief can use this type of armor.

the leather.

Chain Mail: This is a full-sized shirt, often including a hood and sometimes including full pants, made of interlocked rings of metal. It is worn over a quilted shirt called a *gambeson*. When someone with a heavy weapon hits a character in chain mail, the gambeson keeps the chain mail's links from being driven into the flesh. (Additionally, it keeps him from being chilled by flesh-to-metal contact in cool weather and from being pinched by the rings.)

Leather Armor: This armor is made of tough leather, often boiled for extra toughness, or even boiled in wax (which produces armor known as *cuir-bouilli*).

Plate Mail: This is not the full plate armor usually associated with knights. It consists of numerous metal plates (the chestplate being the most important of them) linked together by chain mesh; it's much like the chain mail armor described above except that it has large, shaped metal plates reinforcing it.

Scale Mail: This armor consists of light leather armor completely covered with overlapping metal scales sewn or riveted onto the leather.

Shield: A shield can be any of a number of sizes as follows:

- Target or Buckler (a small round shield, with only one strap, held in the fighter's hand);
- Medium or Round (a larger, heavier shield,

![Illustration of three armored figures standing in front of a stone wall. From left to right: a warrior in chain mail and helmet, a female warrior in scale mail and horned helmet, and a knight in full plate armor and helmet.]()![](_page_66_Picture_21.jpeg)

## Chapter 4: Equipment

often with two straps—one for the fighter's hand and one further up on his forearm); or

- Wall or Tower (a huge shield nearly the size of the wielder, usually with two straps like a Medium).

Regardless of size, all shields provide the same amount of protection by lowering the armor class score by — 1. Smaller shields are considered easier to move into the path of danger, while larger shields protect better but are slower to move into the path of danger—thus the benefit is evenly divided.

**Suit Armor:** Suit armor is the type of armor associated with the mounted knights of high romance. It encloses the wearer completely in a sheath of steel, with chain-link joints to permit movement. It is often called plate armor (which is different than plate mail), full plate, gothic armor, or jousting armor. However, suit armor is more like the plate armor made during the last days of armor-making. The arrival of gunpowder forced armor-makers to thicken the armor made, which rendered it too heavy and clumsy and impractical for use, leading to the abandonment of making armor. In the D&D game, the presence of magic has had almost the same effect on suit armor.

**Advantages:** Suit armor alone is armor class 0. It may be used with a shield for armor class — 1.

Suit armor reduces the damage inflicted by most area effects (fire, cold, gas, acid), including breath weapons. The base damage is reduced by 1 point per die of damage, and the wearer gains a +2 bonus to the applicable saving throw. The minimum base damage is always at least 1 point per die.

For example, the damage from the breath of a small red dragon (HD 10, 57 hit points) is reduced by 1 point per die of damage ( $-10$ ) to 47; the fighter in suit armor may make the usual saving throw, but with a +2 bonus, to take half damage (24 points).

Magical suit armor can reduce such damage still further, by 1 point per die of damage for each two pluses of enchantment (rounded down).

If a fighter in suit armor is mounted and has assistance from others, the disadvantages of encumbrance, slow movement, and surprise can be minimized.

**Disadvantages:** Suit armor is bulky and expensive. Its encumbrance is 750 cn. It must be specially made for one wearer, tailored exactly to fit; the cost is 250 gp. Magical forms are proportionately more valuable, averaging 50% greater value than plate mail of identical enchantment.

Suit armor is awkward in some situations, especially when getting up from a prone position or mounting a steed. If attempted alone, the chance of success is 1 in 6 per round. In late medieval times, the latter problem was solved by the use of a strap tied around the wearer and over a handy limb or bar. The knight was then hoisted into the air and lowered onto the mount. In the D&D game, assume automatic success in getting up if anyone is available to help the wearer.

Suit armor is noisy and slow. Its common creaks and clanks can be heard up to 120 feet away and negate chances for surprise. The wearer's movement rate is  $30'$  ( $10'$ ); most fighters prefer to use their suit armor only when fighting from horseback.

An unarmored fighter needs two full turns to dress in suit armor; it takes one full turn to take it off.

Suit armor gives no additional protection against gaze attacks (such as a medusa's) or electricity (such as a blue dragon's lightning breath).

The wearer has a -5 penalty when using any missile device other than a crossbow. If alone, the wearer suffers a -1 penalty to be surprised. (In other words, a fighter in such armor rolling for surprise might roll a 3, indicating no surprise, but the penalty applied will reduce the roll to a 2, resulting in the fighter being surprised.)

### Barding

Some characters purchase armor for their horses so that their mounts, too, will be protected in combat.

#### Barding Table

| AC | Armor<br>Type | Cost<br>(gp) | Enc<br>cn |
|----|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| 7  | Leather       | 40           | 250       |
| 6  | Scale         | 75           | 400       |
| 5  | Chain         | 150          | 600       |
| 4  | Banded        | 400          | 1,500     |
| 3  | Plate         | 500          | 3,000     |
| 2  | Field         | 600          | 4,000     |
| 0  | Joust         | 700          | 5,000     |

Most of these types of barding correspond to types of character armor. Chain barding, for example, is made up of the same material as a character's chain mail. Joust barding is the horse equivalent of suit armor. Field barding is similar to joust barding, but lighter.

#### Barding and Encumbrance

On the Barding Encumbrance Table are the types of mounts for which barding is usually made. Note that one animal's barding will not fit another type of animal, except that barding made for a war horse will fit a draft horse and vice versa.

Listed on the Barding Encumbrance Table is the animal, its normal movement rate, the amount of encumbrance it can carry at its normal movement rate, and the amount of encumbrance it can carry up to half its movement rate. If loaded with an amount of encumbrance greater than the amount shown in the last column, the beast will not move.

Remember that the encumbrance shown is the total encumbrance being carried by the beast. This includes the barding, the weight of the rider(s) and all armor and gear. Encumbrance rates for characters' gear is listed in the Adven-

turing Gear Table.

#### Barding for Other Animals (Optional)

The DM can allow characters to commission barding for other creatures. If he does, here are some rules for the DM to gauge the cost and encumbrance of barding made for other types of creatures.

In Chapter 14, many creatures have a listing titled "Load." This shows what sort of load the creature can carry and with what modification to its movement rate. (Not all creatures have this information.) With many "Load" paragraphs is a "Barding Multiplier." This is a number that represents how much more difficult it is to make barding for this creature and how much more encumbered the creature will be with barding.

To determine how much it costs to make barding for any type of creature, take its barding cost and encumbrance multiplier and multiply it by the cost and encumbrance columns from the Barding Table.

For example, a character wants to find the cost and encumbrance of armor specially made for his griffin. Take the cost and encumbrance values from the Barding Table and then multiply them by the barding cost and encumbrance multiplier from the description of the griffin in Chapter 14. The griffin's multiplier is a  $\times 5$ . The griffin's basic AC is 5, so it will need banded barding (or better) to improve its condition. Multiplying the cost and encumbrance by 5, the banded armor for a griffin would cost 2,000 gp and have an encumbrance of 7,500 cn. The griffin's description says that it can fly with up to a load of 7,000 cn at full speed or 14,000 cn at half speed, so the griffin carrying this armor must be reduced to half flying speed.

When barding provides an AC that is only equal to or worse than the creature's natural AC, it will do no good to wear the armor.

### Adventuring Gear

This section describes many of the items that characters take on adventures.

#### Adventuring Gear Descriptions

The equipment listed in the Adventuring Gear Table is described here. The items are arranged alphabetically for your convenience.

**Backpack:** This sturdy pack is used to carry equipment on the character's back. The shoulder straps leave the character's hands free for other actions.

**Boots:** Plain boots are standard, mid-calf

\* This is the item's encumbrance when empty. When goods are placed within it, the encumbrance includes both the item's encumbrance and the encumbrance of the goods within it. Thus, a fully filled belt pouch has an encumbrance of 55 cn.

\*\* This is the encumbrance if packed. If the clothes are worn, disregard the encumbrance.

\*\*\* This is the quiver's encumbrance when empty. Filled with arrows or quarrels, it is up to 10 cn for encumbrance. A 5-cn encumbrance quiver + 10 cn of missiles (20 arrows or 30 quarrels) still equals only a 10-cn encumbrance bundle to carry around.

clothes, after all!)

Garlic: This is an aromatic herb that repels vampires and some other undead monsters.

Grappling Hook: A large 3- or 4-pronged hook, made of specially hardened iron, this item is tied to the end of the rope and then swung up or over a target. A successful attack roll, with difficulty modifiers as the DM decides, means that the hook has anchored itself to the target. With use of this tool, the characters can often cross gaps or climb walls they could not otherwise climb. The hook may also be attached manually to a nearby surface, such as when a thief climbs a wall and then attaches a line for his friends to climb.

Hammer: This is used to drive iron spikes into hard surfaces. Used as a weapon, it does 1d3 points of damage and can be wielded by anyone

who can use a war hammer.

Hat or Cap: This is standard headgear for the campaign setting.

Holy Symbol: This is a sign or symbol of a cleric's beliefs. It is often used to physically ward off vampires, and DMs may make holy symbols necessary for a cleric to turn undead.

Holy Water: This is water prepared by a high level cleric. It will cause damage to undead monsters.

Iron Spikes: These are essentially large, long iron nails; they may have flat heads or circular, open heads (the latter kind is useful for tying ropes to). Spikes can be used to wedge doors open, provide grips for climbing or anchors for ropes, pry things loose, and so forth. Characters will need a hammer to pound them into hard surfaces such as stone and wood.

Lantern: This is a simple oil lantern that casts light in a 30' radius, burning one flask of oil in four hours (24 turns). Most types are shuttered or enclosed against wind.

Mirror: Your character can use a mirror to look around corners, examine empty rooms, and defend against magical gaze attacks. When a character uses a mirror to watch an opponent, he receives a -2 penalty to attack rolls when he tries to hit that target, and he cannot use a shield (he's holding the mirror in his shield hand). The area must be lit for the mirror to work this way.

Oil: Oil is burned in a lantern for light. A flask of oil may also be thrown as a missile weapon or poured out and ignited to delay pursuit.

Pole, Wooden: This is the proverbial 10' pole, made of wood 2" thick. Particularly cautious adventurers, or adventurers in regions where such objects have proven their usefulness, use poles to prod piles of rags, stir around in watery pools, poke into corners, touch objects that may have traps attached to them, test the sturdiness of floors and ledges, and so forth.

Quiver: This is a container for arrows or quarrels; it is usually made of leather. A lesser-quality quiver is included in the basic cost of a load of ammunition, as noted on the Ammunition Table above.

Rations: Your character needs to pack food and drink when traveling; rations are food that has been packaged for travel. A single ration is enough food to sustain one vigorous adult for a week—that is, about 21 meals. Rations for adventurers typically come in two types as follows:

*Standard Rations:* These rations consist of untreated food chosen and prepared for traveling; they will last up to a week when the characters are traveling outdoors. Carried into a dank, unhealthy dungeon, they spoil overnight.

*Iron Rations:* These rations are preserved food (beef jerky, hard tack, dried fruits and vegetables, etc.); they are not as tasty as standard rations, but they last for two months (eight weeks) in normal travel and up to a week in bad conditions (such as dungeons).

Rope (50' Length): This is a heavy climbing rope that can support three fully loaded humans (i.e., about 7,500 cn in encumbrance). Rope can be tied to an iron spike and used to climb up steep walls. It may also be useful in tying up captured prisoners, pulling doors open, etc.

Sack, Large: This is a burlap, cloth, or leather bag, usually 2' x 4'. It is normally carried over a shoulder (occupying one hand) or tied onto a

leather boots. Riding boots are more expensive footwear coming up to the knee or just below. Swash-topped boots are soft leather boots that come up well above the knee, but the top portion folds down at knee height or below, resulting in a cuff.

Cloak: The D&D game gives no special benefit to characters wearing cloaks, but the DM may decide that a character caught in cold weather without a cloak or similar garment could eventually suffer from exposure.

Clothes: A character is presumed to start play with two or three sets of clothes of the plain variety. Plain clothes are fine for most travel and adventuring purposes; the better grades of clothes are for social purposes. (Characters invited to the king's ball *don't* go in plain or middle-class

## Chapter 4: Equipment

cart or saddle-horn; if carried in hand, it is usually dropped when the owner goes into combat.

Sack: Small: Similar to a large sack, the 1' X 2' cloth bag can be carried over the shoulder (occupying one hand) or tied onto a cart or a saddle-horn. Some characters tie it off their belts or (with quick-release knots) to their spearheads.

Shoes: A character should have shoes if he is going to travel or explore dungeons; the DM might assign damage to barefoot characters walking through bad terrain or treacherous catacombs.

Stakes and Mallet: Three large (18") wooden stakes and a wooden mallet can be quite useful for destroying vampires.

Thieves' Tools: Required for picking locks, these items are usable only by thieves. A typical set includes various lockpicks, fine wire, etc.

Tinderbox: The tinderbox is a small box containing flint, steel, and tinder (wood shavings). Characters use this to start any fires, be it for their camp or their torches. To use a tinderbox, roll 1d6; under normal (comparatively dry) circumstances, a fire is successfully ignited on a result of 1 or 2. Someone with a tinderbox may try to use it once per round.

Torch: This is any 1' to 2' long piece of wood, its head sometimes covered with an inflammable substance such as pitch. It casts light in a 30' radius and burns for one hour (six turns). See the description from the Weapons Table for information on using a torch as a weapon; clerics can use it as a weapon.

Waterskin: This flexible container is usually made of leather or a preserved animal bladder. It has a liquid capacity of one quart and an encumbrance of 30 cn when filled, 5 cn when empty.

Wine: This is the cost of a quart of common wine, not including the container.

Wolfsbane: Sold dried or fresh in single sprigs, this is an herb used to drive off lycanthropes, who cannot abide its presence.

### Land Transportation Equipment

Characters usually acquire land animals, and sometimes carts or wagons, for transportation of themselves and their gear overland. Adventurers typically buy the types of animals for transportation listed in the Riding Animal Costs Table. In addition, they may purchase other equipment from the Land Transportation Gear Table.

**Riding Animal Costs Table**

| Animal | Cost (gp) |
|--------|-----------|
| Camel  | 100       |
| Horse: |           |
| Draft  | 40        |
| Riding | 75        |
| War    | 250       |
| Mule   | 30        |
| Pony   | 35        |

### Riding Animal Descriptions

The animals listed in the Riding Animal Costs Table are described here and are arranged alphabetically for your use.

Camels: These animals are normally only found in desert campaigns. They are better suited to arid climates than horses, and they travel

much further on the same amount of water.

Horses: As campaigns develop, characters will travel many miles in search of adventure. Most characters will probably purchase one or more horses to make travel faster and easier. Types of horses are as follows:

Draft Horses: These horses are huge, plodding animals usually used to plow fields and perform other farm labors. Characters will seldom want to ride them—normally this will occur only when they need to transport an injured person or a lot of gear and they have no other mount.

Riding Horses: This type of horse is the fastest normal steed, but it is no help in combat.

War Horses: These horses are larger and harder than riding horses, and they may be useful in wilderness encounters. A war horse can fight, using its two front hoof attacks (for 1d6 points each), with the help of the character riding it. While guiding the horse, the character cannot cast a spell, but he can attack or perform some other action (such as drinking a potion, changing weapons, etc.). When not carrying a rider, a war horse will defend itself without needing such guidance. Any class can ride a war horse.

Mules: Mules are cheaper, less glamorous animals than horses, but they are very durable and reliable mounts and pack animals.

Ponies: Ponies are small riding equines. Their diminutive stature makes them ideal mounts for halflings, children, and small characters.

The items and accoutrements listed in the Land Transportation Gear Table are useful to adventurers who have the above riding animals.

### Land Transportation Equipment Descriptions

The items listed in the Land Transportation Gear Table are described here and are arranged alphabetically for your use.

Cart: A cart is pulled either by one or two draft horses or by two to four mules. The cart's maximum safe movement rate is 60' (20"); above that rate, the DM should check once per turn to see if the cart breaks down or tips over. On 1 on a 1d6, it breaks down, and on a 2 or 3 it tips over. The cart's carrying capacity is 4,000 cn when pulled by a single horse, 8,000 cn when pulled by two. It cannot travel through desert, forest, mountain, or swamp except by road.

Saddle & Tack: This is a leather and wooden saddle with metal fastenings. It is assumed to include a blanket, bridle and bit, and stirrups. The saddle's capacity does not refer to the size of the rider; it is the amount of encumbrance the saddle can carry in the form of sacks tied to the saddle-horn, weapon sheathes, etc.

**Land Transportation Gear Table**

| Item             | Cost (gp) | Capacity (cn) | Notes |
|------------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Saddle & Tack    | 25        | 200 (Enc 300) | W     |
| Saddle Bags      | 5         | 800 (Enc 100) | W     |
| Cart (2 wheels)  | 100       | 4,000/8,000   | (b)   |
| Wagon (4 wheels) | 200       | 15,000/25,000 | (b)   |

(a) The Enc figure is the amount of weight the empty container adds to the load the horse carries. For example, a fully laden saddlebag has an encumbrance of 900 cn.

(b) The cart's or wagon's capacity varies with the number of horses pulling it; one horse indicates the lesser capacity, two horses indicates the greater. These figures are based on using draft horses. Two mules can substitute for one horse.

Saddle Bag: This is a long, two-pocketed leather container that lies behind the saddle.

Wagon: This is a large wooden wagon pulled by two or four draft horses (or four, six, or eight mules). The wagon's maximum safe movement rate is 60' (20"); above that rate, the DM should check once per turn to see if the wagon breaks down or tips over. On 1 on a 1d6, it breaks down, and on a 2 it tips over. The wagon cannot travel through desert, forest, mountain, or swamp except by road.

### Vehicle Movement Speeds

The animals noted above can pull the carrying capacities for carts and wagons with no problem or hindrance against their movement speeds. The vehicles can be loaded heavier, but movement speeds will suffer.

Simply put, if the animal's normal encumbrance value is equal to or higher than the weight in the vehicle, it can pull it at its normal speed. If the encumbrance of the vehicle exceeds the animal's normal encumbrance value, it can be pulled at half the animal's normal speed.

For example, one draft horse pulls a cart loaded down with 3,000 cn of cargo; this cart could travel at the horse's maximum rate of 90' (30'), though speeds greater than 60' (20") risk upsetting the vehicle and the cargo. The same draft horse can pull a cart loaded with 5,000 cn of cargo, but this cart moves at half speed or 45' (15').

### Water Transportation

When characters must travel along rivers or across oceans, they'll need to find water transportation. Vessels and pertinent information are listed in the Sailing Vessels Table.

Crew numbers do not include the captains of the vessels. All vessels should have a captain except lifeboats, river boats, sailboats, and rafts.

As a rule of thumb, galleys sail only along the coast; they do not venture across oceans. River boats and rafts are used for travel on rivers and will almost surely be destroyed if they venture too far from coastal shores. Canoes are normally used on rivers. All other vessels are suitable for use on the open ocean.

### Water Vessel Descriptions

The vessels listed in the Sailing Vessels Table are described below.

Boat, River: This boat is designed specifically for river travel. The length is 20'-30', beam (width) is 10', and draft (depth under water) is 2'-3'. Capacity: 30,000 cn. Crew: 8 rowers, 2 sailors (one of whom acts as captain). It may be

\*This column shows the vessel's capacity in addition to the listed crew. For example, a river boat can carry 8 people and 40,000 en in additional cargo. "Cargo" includes any additional passengers.

\*\*If two rates are given, the first rate is for rowing, the second for sailing. The first rate is used on windless days (or rounds), and the second on days or rounds when there is wind in the sails. If only one rate is given, it is for sailing; on windless days, or days when wind is against the vessel, the vessel does not move.

† Longship: Sailors acts as both rowers and marines.

‡ The hull points and movement rate figures are for each 100 square foot section (10' x 10').

+ Sailing ships have no marines. If this vessel is converted into a troop transport, it can accommodate this number of marines and keep its cargo capacity, but it costs 1/3 more gp.

rowed or poled; it may have a wooden roof for protection from weather (1,000 gp extra).

Boat, Sailing: This is a single-masted boat, designed for lake or coastal use. The length is 15'-45', beam is 5'-15', and draft is 3'-8'. Capacity: 20,000 cn. Minimum crew: 1 sailor; additional crew and captain may be hired.

Canoe: This is a light wood frame covered with hides, canvas, or waterproof bark; it is designed for rivers and swamps. The length is 15', beam is 3', and draft is 1'. Capacity: 6,000 cn. It may be carried by one or two people; encumbrance is 1,000 cn for one, 300 cn each for two people. A special type of canoe, the *outrigger*, can sail on the ocean; it costs twice as much as the normal canoe and has three times the encumbrance.

Galley, Large: This ship is designed for oceans and large lakes. The length is 120'-150', beam is 15'-20', and draft is 3'. Capacity: 40,000 cn plus crew. Standard crew: 180 rowers, 20 sailors, 50 marines, 1 captain. It has a single mast with a square sail. It can have a ram (1/3 additional cost) and two light catapults (bow and stern).

Galley, Small: Similar to the large galley, this ship is built for coastal and lake use. The length is 60'-100', beam is 10'-15', and draft is 2'-3'. Capacity: 20,000 en plus crew. Standard crew: 60 rowers, 10 sailors, 20 marines, 1 captain. This ship can have a ram (1/3 extra cost) and two light catapults (bow and stern).

Galley, War: This large, two-masted galley is designed for combat; it is often used as a flagship. The length is 120'-150', beam is 20'-30', and draft is 4'-6'. Capacity: 60,000 cn plus crew. Standard crew: 300 rowers, 30 sailors, 75 marines, 1 captain. This ship always has a ram and one deck above the rowers has two light wooden towers (bow and stern), each 10'-20' square, height 15'-20'. It can have three light catapults.

Lifeboat, Ship's: This vessel can carry up to

ten people. It is designed for survival and each has a collapsible mast. The length is 20', beam is 4'-5', and draft is 1'-2'. Capacity: 15,000 cn. Stored onboard the ship is one week's iron rations for ten people. Small ships usually carry one or two lifeboats; large ships carry three or four. Lifeboats are not included in the listed cost of ships. A lifeboat carried onboard another vessel has an encumbrance of 5,000 cn (deducted from the ship's capacity).

Longship: This ship is designed for river, ocean, or coastal use. The length is 60'-80', beam is 10'-15', and draft is 2'-3'. Capacity: 40,000 cn. Standard crew: 75 sailors (acting as rowers and marines), 1 captain. Sixty rowers are needed for full speed.

Raft: This is an awkward floating platform or barge, moved by poles or natural current, and often equipped with a crude steering oar. Maximum size 30' x 40'. Capacity: 10,000 cn per 100 square feet. The raft may have raised edges and a tent or wood hut for shelter. It is often dismantled and sold for the value of the wood (1/4 price) once the cargo reaches a downstream port. It may be found as a ferry at a river crossing.

Characters can build their own rafts if wood is available—this takes 1d3 days per 100 square feet (maximum size 600 square feet). Capacity: 5,000 cn per 100 square feet.

Sailing Ship, Large: This is a three-masted ship with one or more decks. The length is 100'-150', beam is 25'-30', and draft is 10'-12'. Capacity: 300,000 cn plus crew. Standard crew: 20 sailors, 1 captain. The bow and stern are raised "castles" for better field of fire, and it may have two light catapults.

Sailing Ship, Small: Very similar to the large sailing ship, the small sailing ship has a single mast. The length is 60'-80', beam is 20'-30', and draft is 5'-8'. Capacity: 100,000 cn plus crew. Standard crew: 10 sailors, 1 captain.

Troop Transport: Identical in size to the large sailing ship, this ship is designed to carry people. Capacity: double large sailing ship, calculated for men and horses. This vessel often has special modifications. For example, troop transports designed to carry cavalry will have a hatch cut into the side for loading horses or other animals.

#### Ship Combat Characteristics

*Hull Pts:* A ship's ability to remain afloat after taking water or damage is measured by a number, called hull points. Hull points for a ship are very similar to hit points for a character; when a ship reaches zero or fewer hull points, it will sink in 1d10 rounds.

If a ship is reduced to zero or fewer hull points, it can no longer move under its own power or attack with ship-mounted weapons. The DM can decide whether any onboard catapults are then destroyed (he can choose to roll 1d6, with a 1-4 indicating the weapon is wrecked); the crew may use personal weapons normally.

When the PCs buy a ship, the DM decides how many hull points it has, choosing from the range of hull points listed in the Sailing Vessels Table. As a general rule of thumb, a new ship from a good shipyard will have the maximum listed hull points. A new ship from a less-reliable shipyard or a well-maintained older ship will have somewhat fewer hull points. And a scurvy river barge that's taking on water will have the lowest possible hull points indeed.

*Armor Class:* This number is used to determine chances of success for ram and catapult attacks against a ship.

#### Ship Modifications

Some ships can be modified for transport or combat, with additional costs as follows:

*Adding a Ram:* A large or small galley may

## Chapter 4: Equipment

add a ram for an additional 1/3 of the ship's listed cost. A war galley already has a ram included in the cost. Other ships may not add rams.

**Troop Transport:** A large or small sailing ship may be converted into a troop transport by paying an additional 1/2 of the ship's listed cost. A troop transport has 1/3 more hull points than a normal sailing ship, and it carries twice as many troops as the normal vessel of its type. The one troop transport listed on the Sailing Vessels Table is equivalent to a converted large sailing ship.

**Catapult:** A longship, any type of galley, and either type of sailed warship may add one light catapult beyond the numbers of catapults already described for them. The larger sailing ships may use heavy catapults instead. Ordinary sailing ships, troop transports, and the smaller vessels not mentioned above cannot mount a catapult. A catapult and 20 rounds of shot weigh 20,000 cn. Catapults are discussed later in this chapter, under "Siege Equipment."

### Passage

Characters don't have to buy ships in order to get from place to place across the water. They can book passage on commercial vessels. The Passage Table shows the cost of such transportation based on the class of passage and the distance traveled. To use the table, determine how far the character is traveling; divide that distance by the number shown, and the result is the cost of passage per person (in silver pieces).

For example, an adventurer travels 80 miles at first-class passage. His rate is 80 miles divided by 1 sp = 80 sp for passage. A different adventurer, traveling the same 80 miles but going by third-class, would pay 4 sp (80 miles/20 sp = 4 sp).

#### Passage Table

| Class of Passage | Rate        | Minimum Cost |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| First-Class      | Miles/1 sp  | 35 sp        |
| Second-Class     | Miles/5 sp  | 10 sp        |
| Third-Class      | Miles/20 sp | 2 sp         |

The passage classes listed in the Passage Table are described here and are arranged alphabetically for your convenience.

**First-Class:** These are luxurious accommodations. The character has his own cabin (two or more people traveling together may book a single larger cabin). Service is first-rate, and meals are excellent. Each character has 10,000 cn of cargo space in the hold available, and he can easily put another 5,000 cn of space in his cabin. He can purchase an extra 10,000 cn of space in the hold for 1/10 the cost of his passage.

**Second-Class:** These are decent accommodations. The character is in a small cabin with up to three other people; some of them may be strangers if characters are traveling singly or do not arrange to be placed in the same cabin. Service is minimal, but meals are adequate. Each character has 5,000 cn of cargo space in the hold available to him, and he can comfortably fit another 1,000 cn of gear in his cabin. He can purchase an additional 5,000 cn of space in the hold for 1/10 the cost of his passage.

**Third-Class:** These are minimal accommodations. The character may have a bunk in a large common passenger hold; on a smaller boat or ferry, he may just have a seat open to the sky. If this is passage on a ship that can hold 20 people or more, the price of passage includes 1,000 cn of space in the cargo area. A character can keep another 500 cn of gear near or under his bunk, and he can purchase another 1,000 cn of space in the cargo area for 1/5 the cost of his passage. If this is passage on a raft, ferry, canoe, or other small vessel, the character has no cargo privileges because of space contractions. He can bring only what he can comfortably carry on his person, unless he cares to buy another seat at the same rate. The additional seat would give him about 2,000 cn of room for equipment. Food, if available, is meager and coarse.

### Siege Equipment

Should characters decide to lay siege to a fortification or equip a sailing vessel with heavy weapons, siege weaponry and miscellaneous siege information is found in this section.

Many of the siege weapons described here need to be operated by trained crews. For simplicity's sake, the DM can assume that 1d6 days spent working with the ballista is sufficient to train the crew with it. If the campaign uses the optional General Skills from Chapter 5, the artillery skill counts as training with every existing type of siege weapon.

Weapon information listed in the Siege Weapons Table is as follows:

**Cost (gp)** shows only the cost of the weapon itself; ammunition costs are shown on another column.

**Enc (cn)** is the weight of each weapon.

AC shows the weapon's armor class when fired upon at range; in melee combat, consider siege weapons to have ACs of 6.

HP shows the weapon's hit points. When a weapon has taken its listed number of hit points, it is broken and will no longer work.

Full Crew indicates the optimum size of a crew to operate this piece of equipment. More crew

men will not improve its performance. If a crew is less than full, but at least half the listed number, the weapon's rate of fire is half normal. If the crew is reduced below half but not below 1/4 the listed number, the weapon's rate of fire is divided by four. Round down all fractions.

Damage is the amount of damage each weapon can do.

Range should be read as you would for any missile weapon. However, the "Min" figure is the closest distance at which the weapon can fire at a target. A light catapult can't fire at anything closer than 150 yards, for instance. As usual, targets are +1 to hit at short range and —1 to hit at long range.

**Fire Rate** describes the maximum rate at which the weapon can fire; for example, a continuously manned ballista can fire one projectile every two rounds (20 seconds).

**Ammo Cost/Week** reflects the amount of ammunition used during a standard week-long siege. During longer sieges, you'll use the rules in the "Siege Combat" section of Chapter 8. This section has more detailed rules pertaining to the use of siege weapons.

The "Cost," "Standard Size," and "Enc (cn)" listed in the Miscellaneous Siege Equipment Table on page 74 are self-explanatory; the remaining columns are as follows:

AC shows the equipment's own armor class; when someone attacks the equipment itself, this is the armor class he must hit.

AC+ shows the armor class bonus that the equipment provides to those who are protected by it. If an armor class 6 character is inside a belfry, his armor class against outside attackers is a —2. Once the belfry is destroyed, however, armor class is 6.

HP shows the equipment's hit points; once the equipment has sustained that number of hit points, it collapses, becomes useless, and ceases to protect those within it.

### Siege Weapon Descriptions

The weapons listed in the Siege Weapons Table are described here and are arranged alphabetically for your convenience.

**Ballista:** A ballista is very similar to a normal crossbow and was actually the crossbow's forerunner. It is much larger (often 5'-10" long) and mounted on a platform or wheeled carriage. The ballista described in the Siege Weapons Table is the largest one available. It is mounted on wheels (or on a wagon), or it can be placed on a pivot. The latter is the case when it is installed on a ship or a defensive fortification.

Ballista ammunition resembles spears, but

\* These weapons may have wheels attached and be towed. Towing encumbrance = 1/12 the listed encumbrance; thus a horse pulling a heavy catapult on wheels is pulling 1,500 cn.

they have larger heads. The ammunition is nearly useless against constructions, but they can inflict some damage to equipment. They are designed for use against men, animals, and monsters.

The crew of a ballista must be trained to use it, but the weapon does not require that an artillery be present (see "General Skills," in Chapter 5 for the artillery skill).

If a ballista is operated by a trained crew, one of whom is an artillery, it fires at the fighter experience level of the artilleryist. (If the artilleryist is not a fighter, use the equivalent fighting ability of his class; for example, a magic-user of 1st-5th level has the same attack roll as a fighter of 1st-3rd level.) If operated by a trained crew with no artillery present, take the size of the operating crew (maximum: 4) and use the size as if it were the experience level of a fighter; in other words, the smaller the crew, the worse the attack roll becomes. If operated by an untrained crew, the ballista fires as though it were a normal man with a ~8 penalty to the attack roll.

Bore: A bore is a long, heavy loglike device hung from chains; its metal tip is similar to a corkscrew. Instead of being carried, it rests within a cradle of chains so it can be freely rotated. Ropes are wrapped tightly around it and are pulled alternately from each side by two crews of four men each.

In use, the bore is rolled up to its target (normally the gate of a fortification). Two men hold the bore firmly against the target structure while the other men, in two groups of four, pull the ropes in sequence to rotate the bore—first one direction, then the other. The bore actually drills its way into the target. The bore does not require a siege specialist to use, but its crew does need to be trained in its use. A bore is too slow to attack a mobile target of any sort.

Catapult: A catapult is a huge wooden "spoon" mounted in a wooden frame. Its lower end is fixed by twisted ropes, so that the tension on the ropes keeps the spoon portion nearly upright. When the spoon is pulled down, the ropes become taut. The spoon is secured in this position, loaded with shot, and released. The spoon snaps quickly upward until it hits a horizontal crossbar and stops; the shot continues on its way, following an arched trajectory. The range varies by the amount of tension on the ropes.

A trained artilleryist knows the proper amounts of tension for various ranges of fire. Use of the catapult requires the presence of an artilleryist. If you are using the General Skills rules from Chapter 5, anyone with the artillery skill can captain a catapult. Otherwise, the artilleryist must be a hired NPC specialist.

There are two common types of catapults—light and heavy. Either may be mounted on a wheeled carriage for towing, but it must be firmly blocked in place when used. Light catapults may also be mounted on ships.

Catapults cannot be fired at moving targets. An exception is the ship-mounted catapult, which is aimed by virtue of the ship steering in the correct direction; it can only be aimed at very large monsters and other ships.

If a catapult is operated by a trained crew, one of whom is an artilleryist, it fires at the fighter experience level of the artilleryist. (If the artilleryist is not a fighter, use the equivalent fighting ability

of his class; for example, a magic-user of 1st-5th level has the same attack roll as a fighter of 1st-3rd level.) If operated by an untrained crew, or by a trained crew with no artilleryist present, it fires as though it were a normal man with a —8 penalty to the attack roll.

Ram, Battering: A battering ram is a large, heavy log or similar device mounted on wheels. The log is usually capped with metal. This end is repeatedly slammed against a target (such as a door or gate), using brute force to cause damage.

The standard battering ram is 10' long and needs a 10-man crew to operate. For a longer ram, add one crewman per extra foot of length. A ram can be transported by fewer men than it takes to operate it.

The ram is commonly used by fastening it securely to stout chains attached to a wheeled gallery shed ceiling or belfry (see "Miscellaneous Siege Equipment," below). The ram is then easily rolled up to and swung against the target. When a ram is used in this manner, only one man is needed for each 2' of the ram's length; a five-man crew is sufficient for a 10' battering ram. The crew of a battering ram does not have to be trained in its use.

Trebuchet: Somewhat similar to the catapult, a trebuchet is a huge wooden bar with a sling at one end, mounted on a wooden frame in seesaw fashion. Instead of using ropes and tension to propel it, the bar is mounted on a pivot so that part of the bar projects toward the target. A large basket or net is hung from this end and is filled with weights. Ropes are used to pull the long sling arm down and to hold it for loading.

When released, the weights pull the short arm downward and the long arm pivots quickly upward. The sling slows naturally as the weights reach the bottom of the arc and flies open, causing the shot to fly off in a high, arched trajectory. The range of fire is determined by the amount of weight in the basket or net and by the exact position of the basket on the short arm of the bar.

If a trebuchet is operated by a trained crew, one of whom is an artilleryist, it fires at the fighter experience level of the artilleryist. (If the artilleryist is not a fighter, use the equivalent fighting ability of his class; for example, a magic-user of 1st-5th level has the same attack roll as a fighter of 1st-3rd level.) If operated by an untrained crew, or by a trained crew with no artilleryist present, it fires as though it were a normal man with a —8 penalty to the attack roll.

### Alternative Types of Ammunition

Previously, weapon tables have shown damage and cost factors for normal ammunition. Normal ammunition is ammunition of a consistent quality, weight, and size.

In the field, characters sometimes have to rely on available stones and projectiles to launch from their weapons. This greatly reduces the cost of operating a weapon continuously, but is a drain on manpower due to having to find ammunition. The DM will decide in any such instance whether this foraging for ammunition slows down the rate of fire or diminishes the weapon's effectiveness. Foraged rocks may not be as accurate as standard ammunition, and the DM can assign attack roll penalties to those who use them. Only catapults and trebuchets may utilize found stones.

Another type of ammunition is *pitch shot*. Pitch shot consists of a large ball of pitch (sometimes mixed with gravel) loaded into the weapon and lit just before it's fired. Pitch shot does not do normal damage. Where it hits, it does 1d6 fire damage in a 10' X 10' area; it ignites any flammable targets (such as oil) that it hits.

Wooden structures can be damaged by pitch attacks. Damage starts out slowly—instead of taking 1d6 points of damage, wooden structures take only 1 point. But wooden structures attacked by fire can be set afire, causing further damage. A building's chance to catch fire is 5% per point of damage caused by each fire attack. This is cumulative during any one-day period—in other words, a building hit by one fire attack has a 5% chance to catch fire, a 10% chance on the next attack, and so on. Anything set afire will take 1 point of damage the first round, 3 more points by the end of the first turn, 6 points the second turn, and 12 points for each turn thereafter until destroyed.

Catapults and trebuchets can use pitch shots; their firing bowls must be specially reinforced (costing 50 gp) to fire pitch shot. Pitch shot costs five times as much as normal shot.

## Miscellaneous Siege Equipment Descriptions

The equipment listed in the Miscellaneous Siege Equipment Table is described here and is arranged alphabetically for your convenience.

Belfry: A belfry (or siege tower) is a protected stairway. The standard belfry is a 30' tall building on wheels, made of a stout wood frame with thin walls. The walls are covered with uncurled or wet animal hides and blankets to minimize fire damage. The interior of the building contains a well-built stairway. One or two doors lead into the building at the base. A drawbridge near the top of the belfry is controlled from inside. A final set of steps leads to the roof of the belfry, with access protected by a trap door barred on the inside.

In use, the belfry is pushed or pulled up to a wall; troops then enter the doors and climb the stairway. When ready, they lower the drawbridge so that it gives access to the top of the adjacent wall, and then charge across to melee. Some troops may take a position atop the belfry, adding missile fire to the melee atop the wall.

If a belfry is subjected to fire attack, it takes full initial fire damage, but it has only a 5% chance to ignite for each 2 points of fire damage it sustains. (See the description above for pitch shot and see Chapter 8 for more details on fires and fire fighting.)

Gallery Shed: This protective device is a wooden building with a light frame construction. It has side walls but no end walls. The roof is normally covered with animal hides or wet blankets to minimize fire damage. The standard gallery shed is 20' long, 10' wide, and 10' tall. It can be carried by 20 men, and it gives a -12 bonus to the armor class of those within it. A gallery shed is most often used along with a ram or bore, which is suspended by chains from the ceiling of the shed before advancing on the enemy.

Hoist: A hoist is a machine used to lift small numbers of troops over or to the top of a wall or other obstruction. A hoist consists of a light

\* These weapons may have wheels attached and be towed. Towing encumbrance = 1/12 the listed encumbrance; thus a horse pulling a mantlet on wheels is pulling only 400 en.

frame, similar to a belfry's, with a long beam projecting from the top and a pulley on the beam. A large basket, capable of carrying up to four men, is raised by ropes through the pulley and connected to a winch. The rate of ascent varies by the number of crewmen operating the hoist and by the number of troops in the basket. A hoist is normally used to raise well-armed or higher level troops (those who can withstand some missile fire before engaging in melee) to the top of a wall.

Ladder: The siege ladder is a large, sturdy version of the common ladder. It is most effective when used by surprise or against defenders already occupied by attackers from a belfry or hoist. Used alone, ladders are easily toppled or broken by defenders.

To topple a ladder, take the number of defenders trying to topple the ladder (numbers greater than four count as four) and multiply that number by four. The attacker (on the ladder) must roll above that result on 1d20 as a saving throw each round or the ladder is toppled. The attacker may attempt this save once per round.

Mantlet: A mantlet is a wooden wall, built with wheels for easy movement. The standard mantlet is 8' long and 4' high and can shield up to five men. Those protected by the mantlet gain a -4 bonus to armor class. Mantlets are often used by troops who are pushing a belfry up to a wall and by those operating or waiting for use of a hoist.

Timber Fort: A timber fort is a heavy wooden wall built in sections. It is movable only with difficulty. Each section of the wall is 8' long and 4'-5' high. Those protected by a timber fort gain a -8 bonus to armor class.

These two sets of abilities are <i>optional</i>; the Dungeon Master decides whether they will be used in his or her world.</p> <p>Weapon mastery is a character's ability to use weapons with greater skill than the game normally allows. All characters, not just fighters, can learn to use weapon mastery.</p> <p><i>General skills</i> are abilities that characters can learn and use in the campaign. Few general skills are useful in combat, but many are helpful throughout the course of a campaign; they also help define the character and make him or her seem more real.</p> | <p>bastard swords, depending on how he has allotted his weapon choices. One exception is the net; training with the net allows a character to use small nets one-handed and larger nets two-handed, so the net has only one entry on the Weapons Mastery Table.</p> <p>Basic level of ability is the same level of ability you're already familiar with; basic level allows the character to use the weapon effectively by doing the damage and special functions listed on the Weapons Table in Chapter 4. However, a character does not have to use every weapon choice he has to buy basic level of ability with a new weapon. Instead, he can choose to specialize by applying his weapon choices to a weapon he already knows, thus improving his ability with that weapon.

| <h2>Weapon Choices</h2> <p>With the weapon mastery rules, when a human character is started, he does not know how to use any weapons. He is given <i>weapon choices</i> so that he may choose to learn individual weapons. Demihumans do not gain or use weapon choices; due to their longer lifespans and wilderness-oriented lifestyles, demihuman characters start with basic skill in all weapons not restricted from their classes.

| <h2>What to Do With Weapon Choices</h2> <p>For each weapon choice he has, a character may choose to learn one weapon at the basic level of ability. By "one weapon," we mean precisely that—one weapon from the Weapons Mastery Table <i>used in one fashion only</i>. One weapon, for example, might mean a "normal sword"; it does not mean "all swords."</p> <p>When a weapon can be used in two different fashions (i.e., one-handed and two-handed, as with the bastard sword), a weapon choice buys only <i>one</i> of those fashions. A character can have different levels of mastery, for example, with one-handed bastard swords and two-handed</p>                                                                | <p>does with the weapon and the greater number of special results he can achieve with the weapon.

Once the character has spent his 1st level choices, to gain additional knowledge of the use of a weapon he must be trained by someone who has equal or greater knowledge of that specific weapon. That someone could be another PC, but it is usually an NPC teacher found during adventures or through word-of-mouth. In some campaigns, weapon masters run academies where they teach the proper use of specific weapons; sword academies are common. In other campaigns, mystics may allow nonmystics to learn at their monasteries; many mystics are weapon masters.</p> <p>Demihumans can train to reach higher levels of weapon mastery just as human characters can. However, demihumans are eligible to train only at levels 4 and 8 (and level 12 for dwarves) and at every 200,000 experience points after reaching their maximum level.</p> <p>After finding a trainer who will provide the necessary instruction, the student must pay all of the required costs <i>before</i> training can begin. The costs and time required for weapon training vary by the level of mastery sought, and they are listed in the Training Times and Costs Table.</p> <p>A student can train only to the next rank of ability above his own. He can go from Basic to Skilled, for example, and next time go from Skilled to Expert, but he can never jump straight from Basic to Expert.</p> <p>A student can train in the hope of achieving the next level of mastery—and yet fail to do so. The student character has a chance of failure applied to each training period. His chances of success and failure vary by the mastery levels of himself and his trainer, as given in the Chance of Training Success Table. From the character's perspective, failure may occur because the trainer has insufficient knowledge or lacks the ability to train others or because the student cannot fully absorb the new information.</p> <p>Failure does not mean that the character has lost his weapon choice for that experience level. The weapon choice is still there, and it's still dedicated to the weapon and level of mastery he has chosen for it. The student has lost the time and money he has spent, but he may spend more time and money until he reaches the level of mastery for which he has spent his weapon choice.</p> <p>The chance of success is checked halfway</p> |                                |                                    |   |           |            |       |   |         |   |        |   |        |   |              |   |   |   |    |   |   |    |   |   |    |    |   |    |    |   |    |    |   |    |    |   |    |    |   |     |    |    |

through the training period, and the student is immediately informed of the results. (In the role-playing situation, this usually consists of the teacher taking the student aside and telling him that he is not ready yet and that it is useless for him to continue at this time.) The student may then either continue (despite his teacher's recommendation) or stop the training.

If the success roll failed but the student decides to continue training for the full period, the student may then study the same level again but with a different trainer, and his chance of success is increased by 10%.

If the student chooses to stop the training midway, he may then study the same level with a different master at the same chance for success. The two advantages to this option are that the character does not lose the rest of the time he would spend with the first teacher and that the first teacher normally refunds half the cost of training. (Chaotic teachers might not offer refunds.)

As you can see from the Chance of Training Success Table, it is possible (1% chance) for a character to learn a superior level of weapon mastery from a teacher who is actually the character's equal. (Such unusual training matches usually end up with the teacher realizing and announcing that his student has surpassed him: "Now, you are the master, and I am the student!") However, learning from an equal-level teacher is very difficult to do. Whenever possible, the student should find a teacher who is more skilled than he is; when that isn't possible, however, he will have to train with a teacher who is his equal.

At the more advanced levels, characters are likely to train with their equals and just as likely to fail their chance to succeed the first time around. Most characters will choose to finish training with that teacher anyway so that they will have a 10% bonus with the next teacher they train under. Obviously, it takes quite a while to attain the grand master level of competency.

## Unskilled Weapons Use

A character who is not trained in any weapon (i.e., he has not devoted even one weapon choice to a weapon) is classified as unskilled.

If an unskilled character uses a weapon, the weapon has its basic mastery characteristics and bonuses or penalties, but it does only *half damage*. Thus, if an unskilled character uses a weapon that does 1d8 points of damage, he will roll 1d8 and then halve the result (rounding fractions down) for the actual damage. Missile weapons used at the unskilled mastery level also receive a -1 penalty to attack rolls.

## Skilled Weapons Use

When using the weapon mastery rules, the weapons from last chapter's Weapons Table acquire new abilities and damage ranges. All these new bonuses, damage types, and special uses are given in the Weapons Mastery Table in this chapter. Weapons that were nearly identical in the previous rules become much more distinctive here.

Characters might choose to specialize in a particular weapon because of its better damage against weapon-using opponents, or they might choose a weapon for its special uses (such as parrying blows or tripping opponents).

The DM may modify the Weapons Mastery Table if he chooses, either by adjusting listed weapon characteristics or by adding new weapons. He should not add any new weapons that are significantly more powerful than the ones listed in the table; new weapons should be assigned balanced benefits and weaknesses.

### Types of Benefits

Characters gain several benefits from weapon mastery. These benefits include extra damage, attack roll bonuses, improved range with missiles and thrown weapons, ability to throw some hand-to-hand weapons, bonuses to armor class, and other special results (stunning, paralysis, entanglement, etc.).

### Applying Benefits

Some maneuvers and special weapon effects in these rules provide bonuses to attack rolls in combat. These benefits are applied before other modifiers. Using this method, high-experience fighters and demihumans might gain enough bonuses to bring the attack roll needed to 2 or less, activating their Multiple Attacks option. (Multiple Attacks are described in the "Combat Maneuvers" section in Chapter 8.)

Other weapon mastery benefits can be applied during the normal course of the combat sequence. Benefits such as the greater damage available can be a crucial factor when doubled by a thief's Backstab ability.

Some benefits can occur only if the player announces that his character is deliberately using them (such as deflecting, disarming, etc.). The player must always tell the DM he is using one of these options. He must mention this use *before he rolls to hit*. It is too late to mention it after the die has been cast.

Armor class bonuses gained through weapon mastery should be applied automatically in all applicable situations. However, players may want to remind the DM once or twice.

## Attack and Defense Benefits

There are a number of attack and defense benefits available to characters when using the weapon mastery rules. These are outlined in the following text.

### Opponent Type and Damage Bonuses

Many damage increases and attack roll bonuses vary with the type of opponent. Opponents that attack with two-handed missile fire devices have similar defenses to those that attack with natural body weaponry. This type of opponent is designated "M" (for Missile or Monster) on the Weapons Mastery Table.

Defense is very different for opponents using hand-held weapons that are swung (such as swords and axes) or thrown (such as daggers and bolts) and opponents using missile-fire weapons that need only one hand (sling, short blowguns, preloaded light crossbows). On the Weapons Mastery Table, these opponents are designated "H" (for Hand-held).

If an opponent could fit into both categories (such as a wererat carrying a sword, who has both natural body weaponry and a hand-held weapon), the character attacking that opponent uses his weapon's damage results that are most favorable to the *opponent* (not to the attacker!). However, if this type of opponent drops the weapon it holds, it immediately becomes category M for all calculations.

Most weapons are better when attacking one or the other of these defense categories. On the Weapons Mastery Table, each weapon's listing shows a primary opponent (the category of defense against which the weapon is most effective) and a secondary opponent (the other category, against which it is less effective). A few weapons are equally good against both target types; they bear the table notation  $[P = A]$ , where "A" stands for All.

### Attack Roll Bonuses

Characters with skilled or better weapon masters receive bonuses to the attack roll with the mastered weapons, as noted in the Attack Roll Bonuses Table. When the character successfully completes training and achieves a new level of weapon mastery, he gains his new applicable attack roll bonuses and all other special weapon benefits from the new level of mastery (listed in the Weapons Mastery Table and described in the weapon descriptions section below).

### Attack Roll Bonuses Table

| Level of Mastery | Bonus       |               |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
|                  | vs. Primary | vs. Secondary |
| Unskilled        | No bonus    | No bonus      |
| Basic            | No bonus    | No bonus      |
| Skilled          | +2          | +1            |
| Expert           | +4          | +2            |
| Master           | +6          | +4            |
| Grand Master     | +8          | +6            |

Even with the additional bonuses gained from weapon mastery, don't forget to apply a character's Strength adjustment to all melee attack rolls and to melee and thrown-weapon damage rolls. Also apply his Dexterity adjustment to all thrown and missile attack rolls.

# Chapter 5: Other Character Abilities

## Improved Range

A character at skilled or better mastery with a ranged weapon can often fire or hurl it farther than someone less accomplished. All notes on improved weapon ranges are on the Weapons Mastery Table. Remember that the ranges for thrown and missile weapons are calculated in feet in indoor settings and in yards in outdoor combat.

## Throwing Ability With Hand-to-Hand Weapons

Weapon masters can throw some weapons that other character's can't throw effectively. Masters of battle axes, clubs and torches, war hammers, bastard swords, normal swords, and short swords can throw these in combat starting at the expert level of mastery. Ranges for these weapons are given on the Weapons Mastery Table, and there are rules for *rarely thrown weapons* after the table.

## Bonuses to the Wielder's Armor Class

When a character is using a weapon he has mastered, he gains an armor class bonus (above any he might receive from his armor or defensive maneuvers). The armor class bonus he receives applies only to a given number of attacks per round. That number is given on the Weapons Mastery Table, and it may apply to M (Missile/Monster) attackers, H (Hand-held) attackers, or A (All) attackers, as shown on the table. For example, if the table says that the character has M -2AC/2, it means that he gets a -2 armor class bonus against the first two attacks made against him that round by missiles or monster attackers. Likewise, A: -6AC/3 indicates that the character gets a -6 armor class bonus against the first three attacks made against him that round by any missile or monster attacker.

Some shields do not have a number after a slash mark; that means that the shield provides the character an additional armor class benefit all the time the shield is held, not just for a certain number of attacks per round.

Having an armor class bonus does not count as a maneuver; the character may still move and attack at normal rates.

## Defensive Maneuvers

In addition to the above armor class bonuses, a character may have an armor class adjustment due to Fighting Withdrawal and Parry defensive maneuvers, as described in Chapter 8.

## Special Results

Weapon masters can do some amazing things with their weapons; they get "more performance" out of the weapons they've mastered. Most of the special results are listed in the "Special Effects" column of the Weapons Mastery Table and are described in the section on descriptions of special effects, which follows the table.

However, one special result is common to all weapons: the *despair effect*.

### Despair Effect

A weapon master's amazing ability with his weapon can cause despair and fear in some opponents. This is called the despair effect. When it happens, the targets affected must make a standard morale check (described in Chapter 8).

Opponents must be above animal intelligence to be affected.

Targets that fail their morale rolls try to flee or surrender at their next opportunity. The DM should describe the expressions of the monsters who've had to make special despair morale checks, but he or she shouldn't describe whether the monsters successfully made their rolls until it's time for them to act.

When to Roll for Despair: The DM should have affected monsters and NPCs make their morale rolls under any of the following circumstances:

- The weapon user inflicts maximum possible damage with his weapon.
- The weapon user avoids all damage in a round by deflecting the opponent's blows. (Deflecting is described in the section on descriptions of special effects after the Weapons Mastery Table.)
- The weapon user disarms two or more opponents in the same round.

The DM may choose to check for despair during other special situations if he desires.

PC Victims of Despair: Player characters under a despair effect must make a saving throw vs. death ray. If they succeed, they are merely impressed; those who fail must retreat in awe for 1d6 rounds.

Numbers Affected: The despair effect can only affect a certain number of enemies at a time. This varies with the character's level of mastery as

### follows:

Basic—no despair effect possible.

Skilled—up to 4 hit dice or levels.

Expert—up to 8 hit dice or levels.

Master—up to 12 hit dice or levels.

Grand Master—up to 16 hit dice or levels.

When the despair effect is turned on a group, it always affects the lowest-level (or lowest-HD) enemies first.

Frequency of Use: A weapon master can only use his despair ability once per fight (once the current situation leaves the combat sequence, the fight is over).

## Other Notes

When choosing a character's weapons, keep the character in mind; be sure to select the weapons the *character* (not necessarily the player!) would choose. Be aware of standard weapon restrictions. Halfflings can only use small weapons, for example.

Weapons that do a wide range of damage are present in each category. Low damage is usually offset by special benefits. Once a suitable weapon is found, review the other weapons within that category with comparable damage or special effects and consider the weapon's potential (available with further training). Weapon mastery choices, once taken, cannot be changed.

Remember that weapon mastery bonuses apply only when the character is using the weapon he has mastered, not when he uses other weapons, even similar ones.

## How to Read the Weapon Mastery Table

The columns on the table provide the following information:

**Weapon:** This column gives not only the weapon name but also many other details about its use; compare the symbols beneath the weapon name to the list of abbreviations at the bottom of the table.

**Lvl:** This heading stands for "level of mastery." Each weapon has statistics listed for five different levels of mastery. If your character has expert mastery with a normal sword, he'd find the entry for normal sword and skip down to the line labeled "EX" (for Expert) in this column.

**Ranges:** This column shows the weapon's range when thrown or launched. Not all weapons have ranges listed. Note that the weapon's range increases with each new level of mastery.

**Damage:** This column shows the damage the weapon does. Damage, too, increases with each new level of mastery. This column often has separate entries for "P" and "S"—the weapon does different amounts of damage to its primary and secondary target types.

**Defense:** This column shows the effects the weapon has on the armor class of its wielder.

**Special Effects:** This column summarizes the weapon's special abilities; you will need to read the text after the table to understand what these notations mean. Certain weapons have an additional symbol ("\$") in this column; this symbol indicates that these weapons have special effects beyond the other weapons' special effects. Read the following text for more information on these particular weapons.

Five weapons—the blackjack, blowgun, bola, net, and whip—are listed on the Weapons Mastery Table with an "\$" symbol in their "Special Effects" column. This means you need to refer to the following Special Effects Tables to see what *else* these weapons do to their victims.

### Special Effects Descriptions

The special effects listed for weapons in the Weapons Mastery Table are described here and are arranged alphabetically for your convenience.

**Breaks:** Whenever the wielder of a shield weapon or his foe rolls the exact number needed to hit the other, there is a chance that one of the shield weapon's blades will break. With a subse-

quent roll of 5 or less on 1d10, a blade breaks.

**Charge:** If the wielder charges 20 yards or more and strikes his target, the victim takes double damage.

**Death:** The victim is reduced to 0 hit points.

**Deflect:** In *addition* to any attacks, the wielder of this weapon may attempt to deflect the number of melee and thrown weapon attacks indicated in one round. To deflect each attack, the character must make a saving throw vs. death ray.

**Delay:** The victim hit by this weapon must make a saving throw or lose initiative the next round. If the type of saving throw is not specified, it is a saving throw vs. paralysis. For missile attacks, this effect occurs only at the indicated ranges.

**Disarm:** The wielder of this weapon may attempt to disarm an opponent instead of making a normal attack. The attacker must roll to hit the target. The victim can save his weapon by rolling less than or equal to his Dexterity on 1d20. If the attacker has the Disarm Combat option, the victim must add a +5 penalty to his die roll. The DM should determine Dexterity scores for NPCs and monsters or else assume a Dexterity score of 11. In addition, for each level of mastery the attacker has gained beyond basic, the victim suffers a penalty of +1 to his roll vs. the effect.

**Double Damage:** On a natural roll of the number(s) indicated, the weapon inflicts double damage.

**Entangle:** An entangled victim cannot attack, cast spells, or move. The victim may make a saving throw vs. death ray each round to escape.

**Hook:** Instead of making a normal attack, the wielder of this weapon may attempt to hook and pull down a foe. The attacker must roll to hit. This causes the minimum damage possible for the weapon; the victim must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or fall down. A +4 bonus to attack rolls applies when attacking a fallen foe. A fallen foe also has a -4 penalty to all saving throws and a -2 penalty to attack rolls while on the ground. A character can stand up in one round.

**Ignite:** Fire has a chance to ignite anything flammable that it hits. The chance is equal to 5% (rolled on 1d100) per point of damage caused in each round. If an item ignites it will burn for 1d6 rounds causing 1d4 points of damage each round.

**Knockout:** The victim is rendered unconscious for 1d100 rounds.

**No Off-Hand Penalty:** If a campaign is using the optional Two Weapons Combat rules (see Chapter 8 and consult the DM), the cestus does not take a -4 penalty or the -1 weapon mastery level penalties when used in the off-hand. If the character uses two cesti, he can strike with both weapons at the same chance for success.

**Paralysis:** Paralysis freezes a creature in place for 1-6 turns. A paralyzed creature is aware of what is happening but cannot move, attack, talk, or cast spells. Any cure spell can negate the effects of paralysis, but they do not cure damage in addition to removing the paralysis.

**Poison:** See the Special Effects Tables One-Three for effects.

**Second Attack:** The wielder is able to make a second attack with this shield weapon while attacking with another one-handed weapon in his

other hand. This second attack is made with no off-hand penalty.

Set vs. Charge: If the wielder is aware of a charging enemy, he may set this weapon against the charge. A charge only takes place when the enemy rushes the wielder at 20 yards (or more) this round. If the wielder's weapon hits the charging foe, it inflicts double listed damage.

Skewer: If the target has no more than the number of Hit Dice indicated, the wielder of this weapon may decide to *skewer* him instead of strike him normally. A normal attack consists of striking the target and withdrawing the trident for another attack; with the *skewer*, the attacker thrusts his trident into the target and twists it so that it is not easily extracted. Once the weapon hits, it is stuck; it will remain stuck for  $1d4 + 4$  (5-8) rounds, after which time the victim's movements will cause it to come free. For each round a victim remains skewered, he automatically takes 1d6 points of damage.

Slow: The victim is slowed and can move and attack at only half his normal movement rates. He can cast no spells while slowed.

Strangle: If the attacker makes a natural roll of the number(s) indicated, the victim must make a successful saving throw vs. death ray or become immediately paralyzed and die in  $1d6 + 2$  (3-8) rounds unless rescued. If the victim escapes, he survives but remains paralyzed for  $2d6$  (2-12) rounds.

Stun: If the victim is approximately the same size as the attacker or smaller, he is stunned if he fails a saving throw vs. death ray. A stunned character moves at 1/3 speed and cannot attack or cast spells. The character also has a +2 armor class penalty and a — 2 saving throw penalty. A stunned character can make a saving throw vs. death ray each round to recover from the stun effect. For missile weapons, this effect occurs only at the specified ranges.

## Individual Weapon Descriptions

Some of the weapons on the Weapons Mastery Table are marked with either one or two asterisks (\*), refer to last chapter's Weapon Descriptions to learn about the item's special characteristics. If a weapon is marked with two asterisks (\*\*), that weapon is described here. Items are arranged alphabetically for your convenience.

Blowguns: A victim hit by a poisoned blowgun dart fired by someone with skilled or better weapon mastery makes his saving throws at a penalty. The weapon master knows how to accurately fire the dart into veins, arteries, and other critical areas, thus introducing the poison more quickly into the bloodstream.

Polearms, Other: The last chapter mentioned that traits of the halberd, pike, and poleaxe could be combined to individualize the other types of polearm mentioned. This is an optional rule to be used if the DM wishes these weapons to be individualized. These additional polearms are detailed as follows:

*Bardiche*: This polearm uses halberd statistics but also has the deflect abilities of the pike. The bardiche may be set vs. a charge.

*Bill*: This weapon uses poleaxe statistics and deflect scores. In addition, the bill has the hook ability of a halberd.

*Gisarme*: This polearm uses pike statistics and deflect scores. The gisarme also has the hook ability of a halberd.

*Glave*: This weapon uses poleaxe statistics and deflect scores. The glave causes double damage like a dagger. This weapon may be set vs. a charge.

*Lochaber Axe*: This polearm follows all of the halberd rules, but the lochaber axe may also stun at the highest two masteories.

*Partizan*: This weapon follows all the pike rules, but the partizan may also disarm. This weapon may be set vs. a charge.

*Ranseur*: This polearm uses halberd statistics and deflect scores. The ranseur may also be used to disarm at skilled level and above. This weapon may be set vs. a charge.

*Spetum*: This weapon uses pike statistics and deflect scores. The spetum may also disarm at skilled or greater masteory. It may be set vs. a charge.

*Spontoon*: This polearm uses spear statistics, but it may not be thrown. It uses the deflect scores of a halberd. The spontoon does double damage like a dagger and may be set vs. a charge.

*Vouge*: This weapon uses poleaxe statistics, but it causes +2 points of damage. The vouge uses the deflect scores for a halberd. It may cause double damage like a dagger.

## Throwing Rarely Thrown Weapons

Several of the weapons listed in the Weapons Mastery Table, while normally used in melee, can be thrown by a wielder at high levels of mastery in desperate situations.

To throw these weapons, the attacker must make a normal attack roll modified by Strength (not by Dexterity).

Since the maneuver is unexpected, the attacker first checks to see if his foe is surprised (a roll of 1 or 2 on 1d6). If the victim is not surprised, the victim makes a saving throw vs. death ray to reduce damage by half. If he is surprised or if he fails his saving throw, he takes full damage from the attack.

## Retroactive Weapon Mastery

If a campaign has already begun but the DM would like to add weapon mastery to it, it's not too late. The DM should start by carefully examining each character. Characters often have a few favorite weapons. Assume that these are the character's preferences; these will be the weapons for which the character has learned increased mastery, while the knowledge of the proper use of other weapons has faded through lack of use.

The DM may then give the character the number of weapon choices appropriate for his class and experience level. Weapons that are the character's personal trademark can be bought up to expert mastery; weapons that the character uses frequently can be bought up to skilled mastery; weapons that the character has been known to use effectively should be bought to basic mas-

tery. If the character still has any weapon choices left, his player can assign them as he pleases to buy Basic masteories with other weapons; he cannot buy higher than basic masteory for these additional weapons.

When fitting these rules into an existing campaign, the DM should not allow a character to buy a weapon skill above expert level unless the character is at 24th experience level or greater. He or she should not allow a character to buy a weapon skill above master level unless the character is already 30th level or better.

Refer to "Reality Shift" in Chapter 13 for additional suggestions about coping with sudden retroactive changes in a campaign.

## Weapon-Using Monsters

Monsters may use weapon mastery rules if they ordinarily use weapons to attack. Just as with player characters, a monster must find a trainer willing to teach it. Its maximum possible skill is determined by its Intelligence, as given in the Mastery Limits for Weapon-Using Monsters Table. (See Chapter 13 for advice on determining monster Intelligence scores.)

Note that only humans and demihumans can become grand masters; monsters cannot.

### Mastery Limits for Weapon-Using Monsters Table

| Monster Intelligence | Maximum Level of Weapon Mastery |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Up to 11             | Basic                           |
| 12-15                | Skilled                         |
| 16-17                | Expert                          |
| 18+                  | Master                          |

## General Skills

General skills are abilities that characters can use in the campaign. There are many general skills, but no character will have more than a few of them, so a character's choice of skills will help make him more distinctive and more individually useful in some campaign situations.

Using general skills is optional. If the DM doesn't want to use them in his or her campaign, they won't be used.

## Beginning Skills

All 1st level characters start with four "blank" skills, often called *slots*. (When a skill is chosen, it stops being a slot.)

Characters who have an Intelligence of more than 12 start with more than four skill slots. If the character has an Intelligence of 13-15, he gets 1 additional skill slot; if his Intelligence is 16-17, he gets 2 additional skill slots; and if his Intelligence is 18, he gets 3 additional skill slots.

Different things determine which skills are chosen to fill the character's slots. The player may choose some or all of the skills to fill his available skill slots. Or the DM may insist that the player select certain skill choices appropriate for the character background the player has chosen.

## How Skills Are Used

Each skill is based on one of the character's ability scores (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma).

Whenever the DM feels a character's selected skill is appropriate to a game situation, he or she will ask the player to roll 1d20 against the corresponding ability score. This is called a *skill roll* or *skill check*. If the roll on the 1d20 is equal to or less than the ability score, the skill use succeeds. A roll of 20 always fails, no matter how high the chance for success.

**Example:** If the character is riding a horse and the horse is suddenly spooked and begins rearing, the DM will decide that the character's Riding skill is appropriate to check in this situation. The player will roll 1d20 against his skill-related ability score (Dexterity). If the character's Dexterity is 15, the player has only to roll a 15 or less to use his Riding skill successfully.

Successfully rolling the skill normally allows the character to accomplish the task he is attempting. For instance, if a character is trying to track an animal through the forest and he successfully makes his Tracking skill check, then he is able to follow the tracks of his prey.

## Sample Skills

The Sample Skills Table lists a number of skills appropriate to most D&D® game campaigns. The players and the DM may add skills to this list as the DM sees fit. The DM determines which ability score pertains to each new skill.

![Illustration of two characters fighting on a narrow beam or rope stretched between two buildings, illustrating a skill check or combat.]()![](_page_81_Picture_10.jpeg)

## Skills Descriptions

The skills listed in the Sample Skills Table are described here and are arranged alphabetically for your convenience. Roll skill rolls against the ability under which these skills were listed in the table.

**Acrobatics:** The character with this skill can perform impressive acrobatic feats, balance on taut ropes and wires, etc. A successful skill roll is required to perform any acrobatic feat; failure may result in the character falling. A successful roll allows a character to reduce the effective height of a fall by 10'. A DM can give an acrobatic character a +2 to save vs. mechanical traps where agility would help—such as tilting floors and pit traps. Many entertainers, thieves, and nimble warriors have this skill. This skill is not the equal of a mystic's acrobatics ability, but the mystic's special ability can be presumed to include this skill; a mystic does not have to purchase the acrobatics skill.

**Acting:** This is the ability to make one's living as a stage actor, but it also imparts the ability to assume a different personality or to show false emotions. Successful use of this skill allows a character to tell convincing lies over a limited period of time.

**Alchemy:** This skill provides the ability to recognize and identify common alchemical substances, potions, and poisons. Success with this skill will allow a character to create an *antidote* potion for one specific type of poison—if the DM says that this is possible in his campaign.

**Alertness:** Successful uses of this skill allow the

character to draw a weapon without losing any time, to avoid the effects of surprise, and to wake up at the slightest out-of-place noise.

Alternate Magics: This skill gives a character basic familiarity with magics that are not related to standard spellcasting. It includes knowing many magical abilities of well-known Prime Plane and extraplanar monsters and of Immortal beings. The DM defines what types of knowledge this skill provides in his or her campaign.

Animal Training (choose type): The character knows how to raise, train, and care for one type of animal. The animal can be taught some simple tricks or simple orders. A character who wants to train two or more different animal types must choose this skill more than once—Horse Training is one skill, Dog Training is another. However, a horse trainer can train any sort of natural horse or pony and a dog trainer can train any breed of dog. Any culture that features a strong bond with some animal type will have many members with the corresponding Animal Training skill.

Art: This is the skill of creating art. There are several different types of Art skill (painting, sculpture, woodcarving, mosaic, etc.). The player must specify one sort of art his character practices; a character can take the skill several times and be proficient in several different forms of art. Art skill can be used to improve the reaction of NPCs to the party; if the artist can present an NPC with a portrait or sculpture of that person (and make his Art roll), the artist receives a +2 to reaction. The player can choose for his character's Art skill to be based on Wisdom instead of Intelligence.

Artillery: A character must have this skill if he is to command the crew of a piece of artillery (catapult or trebuchet). He does not have to make his skill roll with each shot; merely knowing the skill is enough. The DM can call on him to make his skill roll each time the character or the crew aims at a new target; the skill allows the character to make all pertinent calculations of trajectory, distance, and throw weight.

This skill can alternatively allow the character to oversee the building and repair of all varieties of siege equipment. The character cannot know how to build and how to effectively operate artillery weapons unless he takes the skill twice.

Bargaining: A successful skill roll allows a character to get the best deal available for goods, services, or information. It's not usually possible for a character to bargain someone into giving him very much for nothing.

Blind Shooting: This skill is the ability to shoot at a target without being able to see it; it is typically used when the character is in darkness or when the target is outside the range of his sight or invisibility. The character must be able to hear the target so that its position can be evaluated. If the character makes his skill check, he can then fire at the target; he needs an attack roll to hit the target, but the character doesn't suffer the normal darkness penalties.

Bravery: With a successful use of this skill, the character can resist the effects of any magical fear. An NPC using this skill successfully can ignore the results of morale checks or of skills such as Intimidation.

Caving: This is an ability to always know where one is while exploring underground caves,

cavern complexes, rivers, etc. A character with this skill will automatically know the route he has taken to get where he is (if he was conscious all the time). Many dwarves have this skill.

The Caving skill can also be used in a maze. Skill checks are necessary when the character has become disoriented. If he is forced to flee for a long stretch, he must make a skill check to keep from being lost. (Characters without this skill automatically become lost in such a situation.)

Ceremony (choose specific Immortal): A character with this skill knows how to honor an Immortal through ritual and ceremony; the skill allows a cleric character to perform normal rituals of his clerical order and could even (if the DM allows) permit a character to gain an Immortal's attention (through devout prayer, fasting, sacrifice of possessions, etc.). This skill includes knowing the code of behavior and the rituals pleasing to the Immortal.

In earlier D&D® game products, this skill was often referred to as "Honor (specific immortal)."

Cheating: This is the skill of winning at gambling games by cheating—by dealing cards from the bottom of the deck, etc. The cheating character should make his Cheating skill roll; each character he plays with can make one skill roll (Cheating at the normal level, Gambling at a -1 penalty, or a base Intelligence check at a -4 penalty, whichever is best) against the character's cheating roll. If one or more of the other players makes his roll lower than the cheater does (see "Using Skills Against Each Other" in this chapter), he detects the cheating. This skill is limited to characters of Chaotic alignment.

Craft (choose type): The character knows one type of craft; examples include armor-making, bow-making, tattooing, leatherworking, smithing, weapon-making, etc. The character must choose which *one* type of craft the skill pertains to; of course, he can spend more slots and have several types of craft skills.

The character can make his living at this profession and, with a successful roll, make expert opinions on subjects pertaining to his skill.

Danger Sense: A successful skill roll means that the character can detect an imminent danger. The character will not know the nature or source of the danger. The DM, not the player, makes the skill roll, and he or she should not tell the player that a roll has been made unless the roll is a success (and there is danger present).

Deceiving: This is the ability to persuade a listener of the "truth" and sincerity of what the speaker is saying, despite the fact that the skill user is lying through his teeth. Successful use of this skill causes an NPC to believe an untrue statement or to accept a misleading statement as honest and sincere. Failure indicates that the character sounds unconvincing. This skill cannot be used on player characters.

Detect Deception: This is the ability to recognize deceptive behavior in an NPC. This does not reveal the truth or falsehood of specific statements, the motivations of the speaker, or the exact nature of the deception. This skill only warns the character to distrust the deceptive NPC. The DM makes the skill roll for the character, informing him of the result. The skill does not work on player characters.

Disguise: This is the ability to make a character look like someone else. A successful Disguise

check is required for each character or group of characters that the disguised character is trying to fool with his disguise. The target that the disguised character is trying to fool must make a Wisdom roll against the Disguise roll in order to penetrate the disguise (see "Using Skills Against Each Other" at the end of this chapter).

Endurance: This skill gives the character the ability to perform a tiring task for long periods of time. A successful check means that the character is able to run (or perform some demanding task) for an hour without collapsing. The character must make another check each hour he performs the task, with a cumulative penalty of +1 for each extra hour. Once the character has completed his task or fails a skill roll and collapses, he must rest for three times the amount of time he was performing that task.

Engineering: This is the skill of planning, designing, and building large constructions such as houses, bridges, dams, and so forth. Unless built under the eye of a trained engineer and materials or pure magic—will inevitably collapse or suffer some other calamity. Engineering skill can also be used to evaluate constructions the party is passing through or over: what shape they're in, when and by whom they were built, and so on.

Escape: The character is often able to get loose when tied or locked up. A successful skill roll means that the character is able to get rid of his ties. Another roll is needed to open a locked door. The DM can apply bonuses and penalties to the check based on the quality of the ropes and knots, the intricacy of the lock, the lack of lockpicking tools, etc.

Fire-Building: This is the ability to start a fire without a tinderbox. A character with a tinderbox and this skill is able to start fires automatically (no roll necessary) in ordinary conditions. If the character is trying to build a fire without a tinderbox, he will eventually succeed; he must make a 1d6 roll each round, and on a 1 or 2 he ignites the fire. If the character is trying to build a fire in adverse conditions (during high winds or using wet wood), he must make a skill check with penalties assigned by the DM.

Food Tasting: This is the ability to taste food and water to see if they have spoiled. Thus the character can avoid suffering from food poisoning by carefully tasting his food first. This ability will *not* detect poisons added to a dish *unless* the DM determines that the poison has a taste (in which case it may be too late anyway).

Gambling: This is the ability to win money in games of skill (competitive card games, for example) and betting. This involves honest games (cheating is covered elsewhere), and a successful check increases the character's chances for winning money at the games.

Healing: This is the ability to treat wounds and diagnose illnesses among humans and demi-humans. A successful skill roll allows a character to restore 1d3 hit points to a wounded character. (A related skill, Veterinary Healing, allows similar treatment of animals and monsters.)

This skill *cannot* be used on a wounded character more than once for the same set of wounds. If the character receives new wounds, Healing skill can be applied against the new wounds. The skill is rolled against a set of wounds, not individually against each injury. (The term "set of

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_83_Picture_0.jpeg)

## Chapter 5: Other Character Abilities

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_83_Picture_2.jpeg)

wounds" usually refers to all the hit points lost by a character in a single combat situation.)

If a healer rolls a natural 20 when using this skill, he accidentally *inflicts* 1d3 points of damage to the patient, and he may not treat that set of wounds again.

Successful skill rolls allow the healer to diagnose type of illness. In addition, a roll made by 5 or more will allow the character to determine whether an illness is natural or magically induced.

**Hunting:** This is the ability to locate, stalk, and hunt large and small game with the bow, sling, or spear. Successful use of this skill gives the character a +1 to hit with a bow, sling, or spear against an *unaware target in a peaceful outdoor setting*; the skill is not usable in most combat situations.

The character can automatically supply himself with food over a long period of time if he is in a fairly fertile area and has a missile weapon, spear, or javelin. In areas not normally rich in game he must make a

skill means the listener believes what the speaker tells him. It does not mean that the listener will agree to actions proposed by the speaker. The DM can assign modifiers from +1 to +8 to the skill roll if the audience is hostile. This is a good skill for diplomats and negotiators to have.

**Piloting (choose type):** This is the equivalent of the Riding skill but applies to sailing vessels. (It can also apply to large flying vessels such as aerial ships and flying castles, if such things are present in a campaign. The use of magical items such as *flaying carpets* and *flaying brooms* does not require the Piloting skill.) A character must use a different category of Piloting for each different type of vessel, as defined in the Piloting Skill: Types of Vessels Table. As such, he will need to spend more than one skill to pilot more than one type of vessel.

**Planar Geography:** This skill gives the character a general knowledge of the Prime, inner, outer, Astral, and Ethereal Planes as described elsewhere in this book. This skill includes knowledge of techniques of travel among the planes and common inhabitants of known planes.

**Profession:** The character is accomplished at one type of nonlabor profession such as politics, cooking, estate management, horse grooming, scripting (the character must be literate), etc. The character can make his living with his skill, and (with a successful roll) make expert commentary on subjects pertaining to his skill. The player must indicate which specific profession his character knows; a character can buy several different Profession skills.

**Quick Draw:** A successful skill check with this skill allows the character to neck and fire an arrow with a +2 bonus to individual initiative.

**Riding (choose type):** This skill includes the basic care and feeding of a riding animal and the ability to control it under difficult circumstances. Riding rolls are required if a character is trying to use a weapon from the back of a riding animal; failure means that the mount is moving too much for the character to use the weapon.

Each Riding skill allows the character to ride one type of animal; if a character wishes to know how to ride two different types of beasts, he must buy two different Riding skills. Horses constitute one type of animal; giant eagles constitute another.

When a character uses his Riding skill on the wrong animal (for example, when a horse rider tries to ride a camel), he suffers a +4 to his Riding rolls. When a character with no Riding skill at all tries to ride an animal, he must make a Dexterity check at a +8 penalty to his die roll.

However, a character doesn't have to make the success roll except in difficult situations, such as when the animal is spooked. Otherwise, he can stay on the animal's back without difficulty.

**Science (choose type):** The character is an expert in one branch of scientific study such as astronomy, geology, metallurgy, etc. Characters

with this skill can make their living with it, usually as specialists in large cities. The DM should not allow this skill to characters belonging to more primitive cultures, but it is entirely appropriate to characters from highly civilized areas of the world. The player must indicate which branch of science his character has mastered; a character can buy multiple Science skills to know multiple disciplines.

**Shipbuilding:** This is the skill of designing and building ships. It allows a character to supervise the construction of professional-quality ships, whether they are made by muscle or by magic. The Shipbuilding skill will also let characters evaluate the ships they encounter, determine who built them and when, etc.

**Signaling (choose type):** Successful use of this skill allows the character to leave messages that can only be understood by another Signaling specialist of the same culture, trade guild, military force, or "school." For instance, one dwarf character with the Signaling skill could pile rocks into a cluster; it would communicate nothing to most characters, but another dwarf character with Signaling would recognize it as a signal and be able to interpret its meaning.

When a character takes a Signaling skill, he must specify the type and culture of signals that he will be studying and he must have the opportunity to learn such signals. Appropriate types of signals include military trumpet signals, naval flag signals, smoke signals, drum signals, etc.

**Singing:** This is the ability to sing in a skilled manner; a character can make his living with this skill and (if he is good enough) can become a famous entertainer or bard.

**Snares:** This is the skill of building traps to capture animals, monsters, and unwanted visitors. A successful skill roll means the trap functions properly. The DM can assign modifiers to the skill roll based on the mount of time the character had to set up the trap, the availability of materials, etc.

**Stealth (choose terrain):** This is similar to the thief's Move Silently ability, with some important differences. The character taking the Stealth skill must choose *one* type of terrain in which the skill works from the following list: city/outdoors, indoors/caves, forest/jungle, plains, desert, arctic, and mountains/hills. The skill only works in that type of terrain. (However, the character could conceivably spend seven slots, one for each type of Stealth skill.)

City/Outdoors is used in the streets, in trash-strewn alleyways, on rooftops, and in similar urban environments. Indoors/Caves is used in dungeons and catacombs, in caverns and caves, and in most enclosed spaces. The other terrain types are self-explanatory.

Humans, demihumans, and humanoid can take the Stealth skill. The character will move very quietly in the terrains for which he has the skill. When he is trying to sneak up on someone

or when there is a chance that he will be heard, he must make his skill check. If the DM doesn't want him to know that the DM can make the skill check for him.

**Storytelling:** This is the ability to captivate an audience when telling stories. The character can earn his living as a teller of stories; if he also has Knowledge skills of such things as history, he can be a storyteller of history.

**Survival (choose terrain):** This skill allows the character to easily find food (especially vegetables and fruits), shelter, and water in a single type of terrain, selected from one of the following: desert, forest/jungle, mountain/hill, open sea, plains, arctic. Desert Survival doesn't give the character the ability to survive in the forest; he must also take Forest Survival for that.

A character with the Survival skill forages automatically in fertile areas, even when on the move. If he is trying to supply more than just himself, he must make a skill check at a +1 penalty to his die roll for each additional person that he is trying to supply. He must roll each day, and failure indicates that he has not found enough food for everyone he is trying to supply.

**Tracking:** The character can follow tracks. The DM is free to increase or penalize the chance of success depending on the circumstances (age of the tracks, type of terrain, number of tracks being followed, and so forth).

**Veterinary Healing:** This is the same as Healing (above), but this skill pertains to creatures that are neither humans nor demihumans—in other words, nonhumans, monsters, normal animals, and so forth.

A character can take this skill in one of two ways: 1) as a General Veterinary Healing skill, which means that he makes his roll with a +1 penalty for every type of creature he treats; or 2) as a Specialized Veterinary Healing skill that pertains to one class of creatures (for example, equines). The character with a Specialized Veterinary Healing skill takes no penalty when treating the creatures that are his specialty, but he takes a +2 penalty with all other types of creatures. (A character could take the skill twice, one General and one Specialized; he would have his listed roll for the creatures that were his specialty and only have a +1 penalty when treating all other creatures.) A character with Veterinary Healing skill trying to treat a human or demihuman rolls at a +3 penalty.

**Wrestling:** In wrestling combat, a successful roll will give the character a +1 to his wrestling rating (see the "Unarmed Combat" rules in Chapter 8). Higher skill scores give higher bonuses, so a character with Wrestling +1 would receive a +2 bonus, and so on.

## Optional Rule for Languages

With the DM's permission, characters can use skill slots to take additional languages. (Additional languages are an Intelligence-based skill.) For each slot spent on a new language, the character can speak the language (not necessarily very well) and can read it (if he is intelligent enough to read his regular languages). Characters still get all the free languages they're entitled to from their Intelligence and racial abilities.

Characters have trouble speaking these additional "skill languages." A character speaking a

# Chapter 5: Other Character Abilities

skill language will automatically understand someone speaking slowly and simply. If the character is listening to someone who is excited or using technical speech, he must make his skill roll to understand the language. Failure means he didn't understand what was said.

The character speaking a skill language communicates in the same way. When he's struggling to explain something fast, complicated, or technical or when he's flustered or excited, he must make a skill roll to get the idea across.

## Improving Skills

Characters' skills can be increased to higher scores. Simply use more skill choices to improve skill rolls, and the PC will get a +1 to his skill roll for every skill choice added to that skill. A skill choice can be used to either improve an existing skill by one point or to buy a new skill, not both.

*Example:* Alaric has only a Charisma of 12, yet he wants to be a natural leader. Instead of using only one skill choice to purchase the Leadership skill, he chooses to use *three* on that skill. The first choice gives him his Leadership skill; he must roll his Charisma score, 12, for all Leadership checks. His two extra skill choices give him an additional +2 to his rolls (+1 for each skill choice spent). His Leadership checks will now be made at 14 instead of 12.

## Learning More Skills

Your character can choose to purchase more skills or improve existing ones. All characters get a new skill slot every four experience levels. Thus, humans get four slots (plus bonuses for high Intelligence) at level 1, then an extra at level 5, another at level 9, another at level 13, and so on. See the Skill Slot Acquisition (Humans) Table.

Above 12th level, dwarves get another skill slot at 1,200,000 experience points and another

slot for every 800,000 experience earned after that. Above 10th level, elves get another slot at 1,350,000 experience points and another for every 1,000,000 experience points earned after that. Above 8th level, halflings get another slot at 300,000 experience points and another for every 1,200,000 points earned beyond that. These points are outlined in the Skill Slot Acquisition (Demihumans) Table.

The DM can simply assume that your character is meeting with a teacher who can instruct him in the skill, or the DM can introduce an NPC who is the character's teacher. Unlike the situation with weapon mastery, the character never has to roll anything to acquire the skill. If the DM says the skill is available to player characters and if the PC has an empty skill slot and access to a teacher, he can take the skill.

Important DM's Note: Intelligent monsters, such as orcs and giants, can also have general skills. The DM may prefer only to give skills to monsters that have distinctive personalities and roles within a campaign.

## Skills and the DM

It's the responsibility of the DM to see to it that players don't abuse these skills and achieve results totally inappropriate to their use in the campaign. It's also the responsibility of the DM to reward characters who use their skills cleverly and in the context of the adventure.

The DM decides when a character can try his skill roll, and the DM also decides what sort of effect the skill can have in a situation. The DM shouldn't make the characters roll over and over for the same task, only at critical points in play.

### Positive and Negative Modifiers

When the character is using a skill, the DM may wish to assign positive or negative modifiers to make the character's roll easier or harder. These modifiers are based on circumstances.

Circumstances that make a job slightly more difficult warrant a +1 or +2 modifier. Those that make the job substantially more difficult warrant a +3 or +4 modifier. Those that make the job very hard—such as not being able to see, working on the rolling deck of a ship during a severe storm, and so forth—can warrant penalties of +5, +10, or even +15 to the roll.

On the other hand, circumstances that make the job easier—such as having all the materials needed, having lots of time, and so forth—warrant positive benefits at: the same scale.

The character always has a chance of success, however bad the odds, as long as the DM says it's remotely possible to succeed. A natural roll of 1 on Id20 is an automatic success, just as a roll of 20 is an automatic failure.

## Time Use

When it's important to know, the DM decides how much time each use of a skill represents. The time it takes to look at the stars and make a basic Navigation roll might be about a minute; the time it takes to make a superior spear, both head and shaft, will be a few days; and the time it takes to make a Tracking roll to recognize what sort of creature left the prints before a character may only be a second or two.

## Using Skills Together

Often, when the character's skill roll has failed, all the other characters with the same skill will say, "He failed?! Let me make my skill roll!"

This isn't a good thing to do. If the DM lets everyone make a skill roll for the same task when someone has failed, one character will eventually succeed; it's therefore pointless to have a skills system since every task will be "automatically" (that is, "eventually") successful.

The DM should usually decide that the circumstances that led one character to fail will make all the others fail. For example, a character tracking his prey fails his roll and loses the track. The DM decides that it's because the creature went to the trees, a rainfall obliterated the tracks, or whatever, *there are no tracks to find*. Therefore, the other characters can't make their own Tracking skill rolls here, except to confirm the fact that there are no tracks.

However, sometimes it's reasonable for characters to use their skills together to solve a task. For example, when two healers are trying to diagnose a disease, two can be better than one.

The characters can choose which of them is the chief problem-solver for this situation (usually the PC with the highest skill), and that PC and the others with the same skill all make their skill rolls. The DM uses the roll of the chief problem-solver and gives him a -1 modifier for every one of his friends who made the roll and a +1 modifier for every one who failed it. The chief problem-solver can never receive more than a -3 bonus this way, but there is no limit to the penalty he can receive if his allies all roll badly.

## Using Skills Against Each Other

Sometimes situations will come up where two skills are in conflict. A character with Detection can try to fast-talk a character with Detect Deception, or two Bargaining characters can haggle. When the DM sees this situation occur, he can have both parties roll their appropriate skills. The character with the lowest successful roll wins the contest. When a tied roll occurs, the DM has to analyze the situation; he may have them reroll for a clear decision or he may decide that the situation is unchanged.

This chapter covers all the information needed for movement in the D&D® world. Using the rules that follow for time; movement; and travel by land, water, and air will help add realism to the game.

## Time

Time is handled somewhat differently in the D&D game than it is in real life. Time that the players experience is called "real time." Time that the characters experience is "game time." In D&D games, the passage of time experienced by the characters is usually compressed. A game can take as little as an hour of real time or up to twelve hours (or even longer with tireless players), but that real time may represent days or weeks of game time.

Game time is not always longer than actual real time. Combat and some role-playing can take much longer than the actual game time. For example, it may take half an hour of real time to play a battle that lasts only a few minutes of game time.

## Rounds, Turns, and Days

Game time is divided into rounds, turns, and days, as described in the following text.

**Rounds:** Situations of immediate danger—such as combat or those precarious seconds when a character trips a trap, falls into a pit, grabs hold of the side, and gazes down in terror at the poison-tipped spikes far below—are normally measured in *rounds*, each of which represents 10 seconds of game time. Except when the rules specify otherwise, each character can perform only one action during a round—swing a sword, cast a spell, or perform some movement or other action.

**Turns:** Slightly less intense situations—such as carefully exploring a dangerous set of catacombs, sneaking up on an enemy encampment, or trying to escape a pursuing army that is a mile or more behind—are usually measured in *turns*, each of which represents 10 minutes of game time. In the course of a turn, should something happen to propel the character into an immediately dangerous situation, the DM will always shift the time sequence to rounds.

**Days:** Characters' lives are not all spent in breakneck action scenes. Sometimes they do things that take a great deal of time to accomplish, such as journey 1,000 miles on horseback, do library research, create a golem, or sit around the city waiting while the king finishes putting his army together. Typically, the DM passes this time in days, describing one or two things the characters might learn or do each day. Should one of these events lead to a role-playing encounter, the DM can always shift to turns and rounds.

See the Measurements of Game Time Table for more information on how these units interconnect.

## Skipped Time

It's also possible to measure longer periods of time simply by skipping over them. For instance, characters might finish up one adventure together and decide they need to fulfill their family obligations for awhile. They split up, each returning to his respective home, and agree to meet at an inn known to all of them after one month. The DM will ask each character what he's doing during this skipped time, give each character the results of his actions, and then bring the characters back together again when the time is up. Great lengths of time, up to years, can be passed this way if both players and the DM wish to do so.

## Assumed and Defined Actions

In D&D games, the player does not normally have to describe every action his character takes throughout the day. For example, when the characters are doing long-distance traveling and time is being measured by the day, it's reasonable for everyone to assume that the characters do eat, rest after and sometimes during travel, talk to one another, behave in a normally prudent and careful fashion, and so forth, without the players having to role-play every single incident or encounter.

## Distance

### Movement, Missile, and Spell Ranges

**Indoors:** Normal movement speed, missile ranges, and spell ranges are measured in feet (90' *measured* ninety feet indoors).

**Outdoors:** Normal movement speed, missile ranges, and spell ranges are measured in yards (120' *measured* actually means 120 *yards* outdoors).

**Everywhere:** Spell effects are always measured in feet.

**Maps and Miniatures**

**Map Scale:** Dungeon maps are usually done on graph paper, one square representing 10'. Wilderness maps are usually on hex paper, one hex representing 8, 16, 24, 32, 72, or any other distance in miles.

**Using Miniatures:** In standard game play using miniatures, 25mm lead or cardboard miniatures represent human-scale figures. If you use 25mm hex paper to regulate movement, one hex represents 10'; if you are not using a hex-grid, one inch on the table-top or surface represents 10' (indoors or outdoors).

## Feet vs. Yards

In dungeons and other indoor settings, the basic unit of distance measurement is the *foot*. Missile and spell ranges are measured in feet; a character's normal speed is expressed in feet. In wilderness, open fields, open city streets, and other outdoor settings, the basic unit of distance measurement is the *yard*. (One yard equals three feet.) In outdoor settings, it is easier to move quickly due to more open terrain and better lighting. Therefore, a character's normal speed outdoors is expressed in yards.

**Example:** A character who moves 90' per turn (normal speed) in a dungeon could move 90 yards (or 180') per turn outdoors.

Missiles and spell ranges are also read as feet in dungeons and as yards in the wilderness. However, the *area affected* by a spell (or by flaming oil, a net, or any other such attack) is not read as yards; it is *always* read as feet. Thus, a *fireball* spell cast in the wilderness would have a *range* of 240 yards, but it would still have an *area effect* of 40 feet in diameter.

**Map Scales**

You may want to keep maps of the characters' travels; it's usually a very good idea in traditional dungeon-based campaigns, and the DM may insist on it. With dungeon or indoor maps, you use graph paper. Each square on the paper typically represents 10' of distance. With wilderness or outdoor maps, you use hex paper. Map hex scales vary widely, but the most commonly used D&D game scales usually have one hex represent 8 or 24 miles. Always check the map key printed on maps. In any case, the DM will tell you if he or she wants you to map in a different scale.

### Miniature Figures

Your campaign group might like to use miniature figures to represent all characters and monsters, especially in combat encounters.

Several types of miniature figures are available from toy and hobby shops worldwide that are made of metal, plastic, or cardboard; the metal and plastic ones are suitable for painting. With so many available, you should be able to find figures that look very similar to your characters. The 25mm figures (a human is about 1" tall) are well-suited to D&D games.

When you use miniatures to conduct combat, 1" on the table surface represents 10' of distance. If a character can move 30 yards (90') in a round, you'd move his figure 9" ahead on the table.

You can use a ruler to measure distances or you can buy one of many vinyl or plastic playing surfaces that are already gridded into inches. Additionally, you can use watercolor markers to draw room and situation details on vinyl or plastic surfaces and easily erase them once the combat is done.

## Movement

"Move: 120' (40'")" gives the character's rates of movement. The first number, usually 120', is the number of feet the character moves per *turn* at a very cautious walking pace indoors; outdoors, the unit of measurement is tripled so that

### Measurements of Game Time Table

| Measure | Equals     | Activities Measured This Way                                              |
|---------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 round | 10 seconds | Combat, some spell durations                                              |
| 1 turn  | 10 minutes | Noncombat movement, some spell durations, exploration of dungeons         |
| 1 day   | 144 turns  | Long-distance movement (miles/day), spell research, magical item creation |

# Chapter 6: Movement

120' becomes 120 yards per turn. (Outdoor movement is tripled because of easier terrain, better lighting, etc.) This first number is often known as "normal speed."

The second number within parentheses is the movement rate per round in feet; this number is often called "encounter speed" and is the number used during combat. Outdoors, the encounter speed would be 40 yards as opposed to 40' in this instance.

Movement is sometimes written as "MV 120' (40")" or "Movement 120' (40")."

## Normal, Encounter, and Running Speeds

Though the normal speed of 120' per turn seems very slow, this rate includes many assumed actions—mapping, peeking around corners, resting, and so forth.

During encounters, movement is measured in encounter speed. Characters move at 1/3 their normal speed in feet per round. In other words, if the character's normal speed is 120' per turn, his encounter speed is 40' per round indoors.

In addition, when characters are running at full speed (toward or away from an enemy), their rate is equal to their normal speed in feet per round (rather than turn) or three times their encounter speed. A character can run at maximum speed for 30 rounds at most (5 minutes) before becoming exhausted. (Characters with the optional Endurance skill can maintain this pace for longer periods of time.) In other words, if a character's normal speed is 120' per turn and his encounter speed is 40' per round, his running speed is 120' per round indoors.

### Exhaustion

An exhausted character must rest for at least three turns (30 minutes) before running or fighting again. An exhausted character who is forced to fight without rest is penalized in combat. Monsters gain a +2 bonus to their attack rolls to hit the character (because he is unable to dodge incoming attacks as effectively), and the character must subtract 2 from all attack damage rolls (he cannot muster the strength to hit more effectively, but any successful hit will still inflict at least 1 point of damage).

A character who becomes exhausted but is forced to continue running cannot use his maximum running speed. He drops to encounter speed and cannot move any faster until he has rested.

## Character Movement Rates

Any character will have a movement rate of "120' (40")" unless he is weighed down by a lot of gear. The weight and clumsiness of gear is called *encumbrance* and is measured in "cn," which are coin-weight equivalents; 1 coin equals approximately 1/10 of a pound in weight and awkwardness. The amount of encumbrance the character carries determines how fast he can move, as noted in the Character Movement Rates and Encumbrance Table.

**Example:** A character carrying 60 lbs. (600 cn) of armor and equipment will be slowed to a MV of 90' (30'). Traveling in a dungeon, at a very cautious walking pace (normal speed), he'll

move 90' per turn; outdoors, walking cautiously (normal speed) but over easier terrain, he'll walk 90 yards per turn.

Important Note: Groups of characters, if they intend to stay together, move at the rate of the slowest character.

## Monster Movement Rates

Monsters' and animals' movement rates are also expressed in the "120' (40")" format. Some monsters move much faster than player characters, but others are the same speed or slower. See Chapter 14 for the movement rates of various monsters.

The only time monster encumbrance is tallied is when the monster or animal is carrying away some heavy prey or is being used to carry riders. Guidelines are found in Chapter 14.

These rules are somewhat simpler than those for player character encumbrance. For instance, a monster will be able to move at its full move-

ment rate up to a certain amount of encumbrance carried. It will move at half its movement rate up to twice that amount of encumbrance carried, and it will not be able to move at greater than a certain amount of encumbrance.

## Land Travel

This section discusses moving over land using various movement rates, the effect terrain has on movement, long-distance travel, becoming lost, and finding food in the wilds.

## Overland Movement Rates

To find the distance a party travels in a day, find the normal speed of the slowest party member or mount (if all party members are mounted). Divide that speed by 5. The result is the number of miles per day the party moves through clear terrain (open fields and range, city, etc.). This number, of course, is modified if ter-

†† The travel rates listed here are possible but will *kill the horse* if only one is used for the entire trip. Typically, a rider only manages to achieve these rates by riding one-third the distance listed and trading his horse in twice at way stations for fresh mounts. At the end of the day, he and the three horses are exhausted, but all are alive. If a rider does not intend to kill or exhaust his horse, he should use the travel rates listed for the war horse instead.

rain is less favorable.

Terrain (the features of the land being explored) affects the rate of travel. Though it makes no difference to the combat round or the 10-minute turn, the terrain may affect the distance a party travels in a day, as outlined in the Terrain Effects on Movement Table.

On the Terrain Effects on Movement Table, modifiers are not cumulative. When two or more conditions are in effect (not counting trail/road), simply use the worst condition to determine the party's movement. When the characters' path will carry them through several different types of terrain in a single day, the DM should decide which one terrain type dominates and base their movement on that type of terrain.

For convenience's sake, character and mount movement in the most common types of terrain are listed in the Traveling Rates by Terrain Table. Find out which party member moves *slowest* on this table; his movement rate will dictate the movement for the entire party.

### Long-Distance Travel and Rest

Characters and mounts must rest one full day for every six days they spend traveling. Those who do not rest suffer a — 1 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls until they do rest. If they go more than six days without resting, they suffer an additional — 1 penalty per six days until they do rest, and they must rest one full day for each six days they spent traveling if they are to lose the penalty.

### Becoming Lost

A party following a road, trail, or river or led by a reliable guide will not become lost. A guide is a retainer who knows the local area or—if you are using the optional general skills rules—is a PC or an NPC who has either the Navigation or Knowledge (of the area in question) skill. The DM may require the character to make his Navigation/Knowledge skill check each day to keep the party on track.

However, if a party is not on a road, trail, or river and does not have a guide, the party may become lost. The DM must check each day to see if the adventurers become lost by rolling 1d6 before the party begins movement for the day. Find the type of terrain the party is traveling through on the following list; if the roll on the die matches the number listed, the party becomes lost.

- Clear or grasslands: 1.
- Swamp, jungle, or desert: 1-3.
- All other terrain: 1-2.

If a party is lost, find the direction of travel (either by the DM's choice or by random roll). The DM must keep track of the party's actual position and the direction the characters *think* they are going! For example, the party members tell the DM that they want to travel north. However, the DM has secretly determined that the party is lost and that northeast is the direction the party thinks is north. If the group travels this direction and then decides to travel in a different direction, the DM will have to adjust accordingly. For example, after traveling "north" for six miles

(although actually traveling northeast), the group decides to turn northwest; the members will actually be going north at this point.

### Food in the Wild

Traveling characters sometimes run out of food in the wild. Cautious parties bring enough standard or iron rations for everyone's use for the whole trip plus up to 50% extra; but great delays (weather, magical traps, other problems) can still cause them to run out of food. However, in most terrain types (but not in some swamps or oceans), parties may either forage or hunt to get more food.

The characters may forage while traveling, but they slow their daily movement rate to 2/3 normal as a result. (They cannot forage while on a forced march.) Foraged food includes nuts, berries, some plants, and possibly small game. In good terrain and weather, characters usually have a 50% chance (1-3 on 1d6) of finding enough food to survive. The DM may modify this due to the terrain, and he or she will make all the necessary rolls.

If the characters spend a full day in the vicinity of their camp, normal foraging is automatically successful. Such characters might (DM's choice) encounter animals that they can hunt for additional food. Days spent in a forced march or resting cannot be spent hunting.

If the campaign is using the general skills from Chapter 5, a character with the Hunting skill forages automatically (without movement penalties) in fertile areas, even when on the move, and he uses his Hunting skill roll to determine how successful he is during days spent in search of game.

If characters run out of food, they will become ravaged by hunger. They will need to rest more, travel slower, suffer attack roll penalties and gradual loss of hit points, and eventually face death from starvation.

### Water Travel

Characters are sometimes forced to swim or use ships to reach destinations via waterways. This section describes how to do both.

#### By Swimming (and Drowning)

In the D&D® game, all characters may swim unless the DM decides otherwise. A character's movement rate while swimming is 1/5 his outdoor running speed (120 yards per round  $H/5 = 24$  yards per round). A character swimming underwater always measures his movement rate in *feet*. Thus, a character who can swim at 24 yards per round on the surface can swim at 24 feet per round underwater.

Under normal conditions, a swimming character is in no danger of drowning. However, if the character is swimming while carrying heavy encumbrance or swimming in rough, dangerous conditions, he can drown. If a character is carrying more than 400  $ext{cn}$  encumbrance, sheer weight will drag him down. The DM should decide on the chances of drowning in rough water, swimming while encumbered, or fighting while swimming.

![Illustration of a party of four adventurers (three men and one woman) struggling through dense jungle foliage, possibly fighting or being attacked by unseen creatures.]()![](_page_88_Picture_24.jpeg)

## Chapter 6: Movement

Generally, if the DM wishes, he can tell the player to make an appropriate ability check each round (for example, a Strength check if the character is battling high seas or a Constitution check against exhaustion) to check on the character's ability to keep his head above water. On the first occasion the character misses his ability check, he slips under the water.

When a character goes underwater—and cannot breathe there—he must hold his breath or immediately begin drowning. He can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to his Constitution score if he does not exert himself; if he exerts himself (by fighting, panicking, etc.) he can only hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to half his Constitution score.

Once a character can no longer hold his breath, he begins to drown. He must make a Constitution check every round. The first check is against his normal Constitution score; each subsequent one is rolled with a cumulative +1 penalty to the die roll (+1 on the second check, +2 on the third, etc.).

Once he fails a check, he has drowned—but he is not dead yet. Although he doesn't breathe, he will not be dead for a number of rounds equal to 1/3 his Constitution score (round up). While he is in this state halfway between life and death, if he can be healed by a character with the Healing skill or by a character with healing magic, he will recover normally.

If this happy event does not take place, the character dies. However, he still may be brought back to life by a *raise dead* spell.

A character who reaches the stage at which he is making Constitution rolls to keep from drowning, even if he is rescued and does not drown, is considered exhausted, as described above under "Exhaustion."

### By Ship

For waterborne traveling, whether on a river or near a coast, characters move at the ship's rate. The ship's movement rate given on the Sailing Vessels Table in Chapter 4 is for average sailing conditions. If the voyage is favored by steady winds and calm waters, the speed may be increased to as much as double the number given. If the seas are rough or the vessel becalmed, little or no progress might be made in a day!

When sailing on seas or oceans, there is a chance that the weather will be unsuitable for travel. Roll 2d6 at the beginning of each day; a result of 2 indicates no wind and a roll of 12 indicates gales or fierce storms. The effects such weather has on ship travel are as follows:

**No Wind:** Sailing ships (vessels without rowers) may not move and must spend the entire day in the same area (hex). Rowed ships are never stopped for lack of wind; they are unaffected by calm weather.

**Gale or Storm:** Results differ whether the ship is a sailing ship or a galley, as noted in the following:

**Sailing Ship:** This type of ship may either sit (80% chance of sinking) or run before the wind. Movement rate is triple normal, but it is in a random direction as determined by the DM. (The DM can see the Water Movement Modification Table for a handy direction generator if he or she wishes.) If no coastline is reached during

\* May take on water (unsailed vessel chance 20%, sailed vessel chance 10%). Taking on water reduces speed by 1/3 until docking and repair are possible.

(triple) one day's movement, the maneuver is successful and the ship is safe (though likely to be far off course). If the ship reaches a coastline or other shore, there is a 75% chance that it will be broken up trying to beach, and only a 25% chance that it will safely find a sheltering harbor. (DMs can modify that chance if they are using the optional general skills. If the ship's pilot can make his Piloting skill check, the ship's chances of finding safety improve by 5% for every point by which he successfully makes his roll.)

**Galley (Lifeboat, Raft):** Any vessel without sails has only a 20% chance of weathering a gale; failure results in the ship being swamped. If the galley is in sight of the coastline when the gale first hits, check the coastal terrain. If it is clear terrain, the galley may beach before the storm hits. For all other terrain, roll 1d6; a result of 1-2 indicates that the pilot finds a safe beach or cove.

(As noted under sailing ship above, a good pilot can improve the galley's chances if the DM is using the general skills rules and the pilot can make his Piloting skill check. Historically, many galleys did have sails, but the galleys found in the D&D® game do not.)

If a DM prefers to add more complexity to his game world, he can add some optional water movement rules for traveling by water. Roll 2d6 at the start of each day traveled by water and check the results on the Optional Water Movement Modification Table.

### Aerial Travel

Characters traveling on aerial mounts can move 72 miles per day. Characters traveling on aerial devices (such as *flying carpets*) can move 120 miles per day.

# Chapter 7: Encounters and Evasion

![Decorative flourish]()![](_page_90_Picture_1.jpeg)

In "encounter" occurs when a player character or a PC party meets a person, group, or monster that is *not* a member or his party. An encounter can result in combat between the two sides, conversation, cooperation, a chase, or similar event. "Evasion" is what happens when an encounter occurs and one side wants to escape the other; that side turns and runs.

In this chapter, standard procedures for game turns and game days are discussed as well as what happens during encounters and during evasion attempts. Surprise, reactions, and wandering monsters are also detailed.

## Exploration and the Game Turn

When characters are exploring a specific area (such as a dungeon), moving through heavily patrolled territory (such as an armed camp or the border between unfriendly nations), or traveling through a heavily populated zone (such as a town), the DM measures time in *turns*. Each turn represents 10 minutes; customarily characters will travel at their normal speed during game turns. Each game turn follows the pattern noted in the Game Turn Checklist.

### Game Turn Checklist

1. Wandering Monsters: If the wandering monsters check at the end of the previous turn was positive, the monsters arrive now. Under normal dungeon conditions, they appear  $2d6 \times 10'$  away in a direction of the DM's choice (see the "Encounter Distance" section, below, for more information). Leave the Game Turn Checklist sequence and go to the Encounter Checklist, below. See "Handling Wandering Monsters," below, for more details on handling wandering monsters.
2. Actions: The caller (or each player) describes party actions (movement, listening, searching, etc.).
3. Results: The DM describes the results of the party's actions as follows:
   1. If PC actions result in a discovery (a secret door, trap, etc.), the DM tells them what they found.
   2. If the PCs entered a new area, the DM describes it so that the mapper can map it.
   3. If an encounter occurs, skip to the Encounter Checklist.
4. Wandering Monsters Check: The DM checks for wandering monsters and random encounters. The DM rolls 1d6 every other turn to check for this. If this is a dungeon and a "1" comes up on the die, the PCs will encounter wandering monsters at the beginning of the next turn (other types of terrain have different chances as shown on the Chance of Encounter Table, below).

## Wandering Monsters

When a DM's roll indicates that wandering monsters will appear, they appear the following turn. The DM rolls 2d6 and multiplies this num-

ber by 10; the result is the distance, in feet, at which the monsters are detected.

This is the distance at which the DM first begins keeping track of them and the distance at which both sides first have a chance to notice one another. Once the monsters appear, the DM should switch to the Encounter Checklist (on page 93) to determine what happens next.

### Wandering Monsters Check

Every two turns (not every turn), the DM rolls 1d6 to check for wandering monsters or random encounters. In any setting where there is a possibility of characters running across monsters (or strangers, wild animals, occupants of a dungeon that are not locked in a particular room or area, or anything else that might be moving freely through an area), the DM can check for wandering monsters and random encounters. For a more in-depth method of determining encounters, the DM can check the Chance of Encounter Table and follow the instructions there for checking for encounters.

If the DM's roll indicates that there will be an encounter, the DM can choose what sort of encounter it is (based on what he knows about the area), or he can roll on the wandering monsters tables later in this chapter.

Important Note: If the Dungeon Master has already decided to have a prearranged encounter during this two-turn time period or if he has decided that the characters will have no encounter during this period, he can skip the wandering monster roll.

### Leaving the Game Turn

The DM continues determining time in game turns and using the Game Turn Checklist until he feels that the situation has changed and he no longer needs to use the checklist. For example, the characters might reach a different type of terrain (the comparatively safe outdoors of the wilderness, the inn where they plan to spend the night, the protected caravan of their patron, etc.), which will remove them from the normal game turn sequence.

## Travel and the Game Day

Characters who are traveling overland or across open water and who are not moving through dangerous territories should travel in game days, not game turns. The rules for long-distance overland travel rates were presented in Chapter 6, and traveling by ship rates were discussed there and in Chapter 4. Each game day spent traveling follows the Game Day Checklist.

## Encounters

An "encounter" occurs when two or more groups come within visual range of one another and at least one group becomes aware of the other; the term is also used to refer to incidents where PCs encounter traps.

In most dungeon situations, groups encountering other groups will become aware of one another at or nearly at the same time. In outdoor encounters and a few dungeon encounters, one group could become aware of the other and not reveal itself, allowing the group members to run away without being detected, spy on the other

### Game Day Checklist

1. Daybreak: Party prepares for travel, studies spells, selects travel direction.
2. Getting Lost: DM rolls 1d6 to see if party becomes lost. If so, see the "Land Travel" section in Chapter 6.
3. Daytime Wandering Monsters: The DM makes a 1d6 roll for wandering monsters for the daytime hours. See the Chance of Encounter Table for determining rolls.
4. Encounter Results: Based on the DM's die roll, the party does the following:
   1. If no wandering monsters are encountered, party concludes movement and daylight period ends. Skip to Step 6.
   2. If wandering monsters are encountered, the DM goes to the Encounter Checklist, below. If the characters want to evade or pursue encountered monsters, the DM goes to the "Evasion and Pursuit" section later in this chapter.
5. Resume Travel: After the encounter, the party may resume travel. If they are lost, the DM may (at his option) recheck the direction of travel.
6. Nightfall: The party finds a place to stop and rest.
7. Nighttime Wandering Monsters: The DM makes a 1d12 roll for wandering monsters for the nighttime hours. See the Chance of Encounter Table for determining rolls. If an encounter is indicated, the DM chooses the watch during which it occurs; two or three PC guards can be posted during the night, each taking an equal amount of time guarding the party while on watch. Continue with one of the following steps:
   1. If an encounter occurs, the DM uses the Encounter Checklist, below,
   2. If no encounter occurs, the DM proceeds to Step 9.
8. Resume Rest: Once any nighttime encounter is over, the party returns to rest.
9. Night's End: Return to Step 1 above.

group, arrange to ambush the other group, and so forth.

Encounters keep game adventures exciting and unpredictable and give characters experience with different monster types. No map and map key will detail every creature, monster, or character that can be found on the area represented by a map, of course, but the use of random encounters can add flavor to a campaign. Characters traveling through a jungle might run across a tiger, a giant python, or an even more fantastic monster; this monster is present because it belongs to the type of terrain in question.

In a dungeon, roll for encounters once every two turns; in the outdoors, roll once during the day and once (at a reduced chance) at night. Check the Chance of Encounter Table on the following page for when to roll and type of encounters.

Some actions or items may increase the chance of wandering monsters. Loud noises, battles, cursed items, or exploring special areas may allow the DM to check for wandering monsters every turn—and possibly with higher chances

## Chapter 7: Encounters and Evasion

### Chance of Encounter Table

**Type of Encounter**  
Dungeon and city

**Roll Method**

Roll 1d6 every two turns when traveling and roll 1d12 once during the night; on a 1, an encounter occurs  
Determine the type of terrain the party is in and roll 1d6 once during the day and roll 1d12 once when camped at night; consult the following for encounter occurrences

**Type of Terrain**

Clear, grasslands, inhabited, or settled  
Forest, river, hills, barren lands, desert, ocean\*, or aerial\*\*  
Swamp, jungle, or mountains

**Chance**

1  
1-2  
1-3

\* Ocean: A roll of 1 indicates a normal ocean encounter. A roll of 2 indicates no encounter unless the ship lands at the end of the day; if so, a land encounter is used.

\*\* Aerial encounters always use the Flyers subtable in the Wilderness Encounter Table, regardless of terrain.

(1-2, 1-3, or 1-4 on 1d6).

When the DM chooses to have an encounter or when a die roll indicates an encounter, the DM must first determine or randomly roll what sort of encounter it is (an encounter with wandering monsters, an NPC or a group of NPCs, or a trap). Once that's determined, he or she can run the encounter according to the Encounter Checklist.

### Encounter Distance

Once the Dungeon Master has determined that an encounter will take place and has determined the relative conditions of surprise for the two groups, he or she can decide how far apart

the two parties are when the encounter takes place.

When both parties are surprised, the encounter distance is  $1d4 \times 10^0$  (or yards if outdoors).

When one party is surprised, the unsurprised party notices the surprised party at the  $1d4 \times 10^0$  (or yards) distance rolled; the surprised party won't notice the unsurprised party until they reach half that distance.

When neither party is surprised, take a look at the Encounter Distances Table. When the type of terrain (dungeon, wilderness, ocean/sea, or underwater) is known, the DM can find out how far apart the groups are when the encounter takes place.

When an unexpected encounter occurs, both sides roll 1d6. Each side that rolls a 1 or 2 is surprised. Possible results are as follows:

**Neither Group Is Surprised:** Both are aware of one another and can be on guard.

**Both Groups Are Surprised:** Both groups lose one round due to the sudden surprise and confusion; once the round is over, both groups are back in control of themselves, aware of one another, and on guard.

**One Group Is Surprised:** The unsurprised group can take advantage of the situation by evading (automatic success, meaning that the other group doesn't notice them at all), by attacking (the attacking group gets one free round of attacks before the other group can respond), or by other means (leaving one or two members in the open to negotiate while the other members hide in ambush, for example).

When the DM determines that there will be an encounter, the DM should roll 1d6 once for each group—or he can let one of the players roll for the PCs, if he isn't worried about tipping them off that something is about to happen. A result of 1 or 2 means that the group in question is surprised (though this may differ with some monsters; see Chapter 14). In any given encounter, one group could be surprised, or the other could, or both, or neither.

# Chapter 7: Encounters and Evasion

## Encounter Checklist

1. **Game Time:** Game time switches from 10-minute turns to 10-second rounds. The DM does not have to inform the players of this until he or she informs them that they are having an encounter.
2. **Surprise:** Both sides make appropriate rolls (1d6), the caller for the PCs and the DM for the monsters. Any side that rolls a 1 or a 2 is surprised. To keep from alerting players than an encounter is imminent, the DM can simply make both rolls him- or herself.
3. **Initiative:** If one side is surprised, it loses initiative automatically. Otherwise, both sides make initiative rolls (1d6) to see who moves, talks, or attacks first. The side that rolls higher goes first.
4. **Reactions:** If the DM does not know how the monsters will react to the PCs, the DM makes reaction rolls to determine their initial reactions. See the Monster Reactions Table under "Monster Reactions," below.
5. **Results:** The DM determines the results of the party's actions as follows:
   1. If the PCs trigger a trap, the DM applies the consequences.
   2. If both sides can speak, role-play the conversation until agreement is reached, one side leaves, or a fight begins.
   3. If the PCs run away, make a morale check for the monsters or NPCs to see if they give chase. If so, use the pursuit and evasion rules later this chapter to see if the PCs get away.
   4. If one or both sides attack, play proceeds with the Combat Sequence Checklist (see Chapter 8, page 102; start with Step 1 and roll for initiative again).
6. **Encounter Ends:** After the encounter ends, begin play with a new turn. Always assume that an encounter takes at least one full turn to resolve.

When neither group is surprised, both can act at the same time. If one decides to attack, the other can respond immediately. If one decides to run, the other can give chase. Neither has an advantage over the other.

The same applies when both groups are surprised. Both groups are caught off guard and lose a little time gathering their wits; neither group recovers before the other does. Once they have themselves under control, they proceed as though neither group was surprised.

When one group surprises the other, it can, if it chooses, take advantage of the situation. It might attack, in which case it would get a free round of attacks on the other group before the surprised group could respond. It might also try to sneak away, in which case it would avoid the other group automatically, with no chance for the other group to discover or catch it.

When surprise occurs, the DM looks at the terrain and situation and decides exactly what has happened, describing this to the players, who must work within the limits of the situation.

\* Or other indoor setting.

\*\* Or full darkness with infrared used.

t Or very poor visibility (heavy snow or fog, sandstorm, etc.).

## Monster Reactions

Just because an encounter takes place does not mean that the two parties automatically attack one another. Either party may be in a mood to trade, talk, exchange rumors and information, or even run away from one another.

The player characters determine how they wish to react. The DM decides how the monsters and NPCs will react. Descriptions of some monsters (see Chapter 14) will determine how they react, while the DM might wish a monster to react a certain way. When the DM wants to use a random reaction for the monster or NPC, he can consult the Monster Reactions Table.

If the DM wants to use the random Monster Reactions Table for the PCs' encounters with monsters and NPCs, he can roll 2d6 on the table and apply the indicated results. After the first round, the DM should modify the 2d6 roll of the character talking for the group by the character's Charisma bonuses or penalties. For the first reaction roll, the DM shouldn't take Charisma adjustments into account.

### Monster Reactions Table

| Roll  | 2d6                                                                                                 | Monster Reaction |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| 2-3   | Monster attacks                                                                                     |                  |
| 4-6   | Monster is aggressive (growls, threatens); roll again in one round with a penalty of -4 to the roll |                  |
| 7-9   | Monster is cautious; roll again in one round                                                        |                  |
| 10-11 | Monster is neutral; roll again in one round with a bonus of +4 to the roll                          |                  |
| 12    | Monster is friendly                                                                                 |                  |

The DM can substitute any appropriate response for the ones described above. A cowardly monster that rolls a 2-3, for instance, might flee instead of attacking; if it rolls a 4-6 instead, it might shy away from the PCs and be ready to run.

You may need to make more than one roll on the Monster Reactions Table. When the result says to roll again in one round, allow the PCs to react to the monster. If they do something to get a specific reaction (such as attack), you won't need to roll again. If they try to bluff, negotiate, or befriend the creature, roll again with the penalty or bonus listed on the table.

The actions or words of the PCs may affect monsters' reactions. Gestures of friendship can give the PCs a bonus at the DM's discretion; threats, attempts to appear menacing, and rudeness can give the PCs a penalty. Adjustments for PC actions can range from a -2 penalty to a +2 bonus. If a charismatic character is speaking for his entire party while another character is silently glaring, bristling, and otherwise indicating that he's a tough guy, the rudeness penalty could easily cancel the Charisma bonus.

Don't roll more than three times. If by the third roll the monster hasn't achieved a roll of 10 or better, it will decide to attack or leave.

## Wandering Monster Encounters

The tables in this section will help generate wandering monster and random encounters. The Dungeon Encounters Levels 1-10 Tables give guidelines for the number of monsters that constitute an "encounter." For instance, an entry might read "Hogoblin 1d6"; in such a case, roll 1d6 for the number of hogoblins encountered by the player characters.

In the Wilderness Encounters Table, Castle Encounters Table, and City Encounters Table, no such number guidelines are given. Consult the description of the monster in question from Chapter 14; the text with the headline "Number of Monsters" gives handy guidelines for selecting numbers of monsters for encounters.

The tables in this section are general tables for an "average" dungeon. The Dungeon Master is encouraged to make his own specific encounter table for specific dungeons and settings in his campaign. These can change the frequency of monsters, introduce new monsters of the DM's creation, use a different type of die (d8, d12, etc.), and so on.

When a random encounter is to occur, the DM first needs to know where the characters are—dungeon or wilderness. "City" is treated just like any other wilderness terrain.

If the random encounter is in a dungeon setting, go to the "Dungeon Encounters" section below. If it's a wilderness (or a city) setting, go to the "Wilderness Encounters" section. Both start on page 95.

# Chapter 7: Encounters and Evasion

## Dungeon Encounters

Determine the dungeon level where the encounter takes place. Consult the table corresponding to that dungeon level. Roll 1d20 on that table to see what sort of monster is encountered.

Make whatever die roll is indicated in the "Number Encountered" column to determine how many monsters of that type appear in this encounter. Consult Chapter 14 for details about that monster.

Play out the encounter as described earlier under "Encounters."

In dungeon encounters, first determine the dungeon level where the encounter is taking place. The DM or writer who created the dungeon will normally have designated it "Level 1," "Level 2," or some such. If he or she hasn't, look at the types of monsters found on the dungeon level; if they tend to average 1 experience level or HD, it's probably Level 1; if they tend to average 3 experience levels or HD, it's probably level 3; and so on.

Below are tables for several different dungeon levels. Roll 1d20 on the table that corresponds to the dungeon level in question. The 1d20 result will identify a type of monster. Now roll the dice indicated in the right-hand column to determine how many of that monster are involved in the encounter.

For example, on the first level of a dungeon, the DM rolls an encounter. He consults the Dungeon Encounters Level 1 Table below and rolls 1d20; the result is a 14. According to the table, the encounter will be with orcs. The die roll in the "Number Appearing" column of the table is 1d6; the DM rolls 1d6 and gets a 4. This means that the encounter is with four orcs. The DM can now consult the description of orcs in Chapter 14 to see what they do, how tough they are, how they behave, and so forth.

The monsters listed in the Dungeon Encounters Tables are different levels of difficulty, depending on the level of dungeon they are typically found in. Later in this book is a section on dungeon design that discusses the difference in difficulty between different levels of a dungeon.

## Wilderness Encounters

Find the type of terrain on the Wilderness Encounters Table where the encounter is taking place. Roll 1d8 and check the column corresponding to the terrain type. The result tells which subtable to consult. Go to that subtable and roll 1d12 on the column corresponding to the terrain type where the encounter is taking place. The result tells which monster the characters encounter.

See Chapter 14 for details about that monster, including how many monsters appear. Play out the encounter as described under "Encounters" on page 91, using the visibility, distance, and surprise factors.

In a wilderness encounter, the type of terrain plays an important part. On the Wilderness Encounters Table, roll 1d8 and check the result

against the column corresponding to the correct terrain type. This will direct you to one of eleven subtables, nine of which immediately follow the main table. The other two subtables are presented with explanatory text in the sections that follow the the ninth subtable.

Roll 1d12 on the subtable indicated by the previous roll. Check the 1d12 result against the column corresponding to the terrain type.

**Example:** The player characters are traveling through heavily wooded mountains. The DM decides that this is more mountainous terrain than it is wooded. She rolls on the Wilderness Encounters Table; her 1d8 roll is a 6. On the "Barren, Mountain, Hill" column, a humanoid encounter is indicated. The DM looks at the humanoid subtable, rolls 1d12, and checks the result against the column for "Barren, Mountain, Hill." The DM's roll is a 2, which indicates a cloud giant for the PCs' encounter.

Once the encountered monster is determined, see Chapter 14 for details about that monster. Chapter 14 will describe the monster's habits, activities, number likely to appear, and so forth.

With all the information in hand, the encounter with the PCs is ready to play out. Consult the Encounter Checklist and the Encounter Distances Table for other factors regarding encounters.

### Special Castle Encounters

The DM can determine character class of castle inhabitants either by using the Subtable: 10. Castle Encounters (page 98) or by selecting classes as appropriate. If the table is to be used, roll a

1d6; if the result is a 3, roll 1d6 again and see which of the demihuman races is the result. For human owners of a castle, regardless of class, roll 1d20+8 for the owner's level. Demihumans' levels are listed in the table.

If the DM has not already determined what the castle inhabitants' reactions will be to player characters, he or she can either check the Monster Reactions Table given earlier in this chapter or check the Castle Reactions Table on page 99. The "Reaction" columns of the table assume that the party does nothing to either arouse suspicion or to inspire trust; the DM can certainly adjust the die roll if the PCs' actions toward the castle inhabitants warrant the modification.

Remember, too, that some high-level PC fighters may have the right of sanctuary at castles in the campaign; a PC with that right who declares his name and title will normally receive a "Friendly" result.

Note that the men listed are only part of the castle owner's forces and are simply the unit sent out after annoying travelers; the rest of the castle's forces should include other men and might even include special monsters.

Pursue: The men will chase the party off the lord's land or charge the characters a toll. This sum may vary depending on the personality of the lord, how wealthy the characters look, and other factors. Refusing to pay may result in the PCs being arrested, run off the land, or attacked. The DM can ignore this result if the castle owner is Lawful and the PCs have behaved well.

Ignore: No attempt is made to aid or hinder the party.

Friendly: The castle owner invites the party to stay. (This is not necessarily actual friendship; some NPCs may have evil intentions toward the unsuspecting party. . .)

### Special City Encounters

On the Wilderness Encounters Table, the entry for city terrain has a "Special" result. When

ever a special result is rolled, the DM can either roll again and use one of the more common results, or he or she can roll on the Subtable: 11. City Encounters (on page 98).

To use this subtable, roll 1d8 to find the section of the subtable to be used (the subtable is split into sections marked 1-8). Then roll 1d20 to find out what sort of person the PCs encounter.

The Subtable: 11. City Encounters indicates only the encountered character's profession—not his level or intent. The DM must decide how to use this type of character in the encounter.

For example, an Alchemist might wish to hire the characters to find him some rare ingredients; an Assassin might be stalking one of the PCs; a Brewer could have set up a drinking contest to determine whose beer is better—his own or a competitor's—and tries to persuade a PC to participate; and lastly, a Government Official could be seeking revenge against a high-ranking thief who is blackmailing him, and he might try to persuade the PCs to help him.

You can also use the Subtable: City Encounters when trying to think of an interesting location for an encounter. Translate the name of the type of character to the appropriate type of building or site—for instance, "Judge" would become "Courtroom," while "Undertaker" would become "Cemetery."

## Wandering Monsters and High-Level PCs

In low-level play, wandering monsters help make adventures interesting, keep the characters alert, and give the characters experience in dangerous situations. Once the characters are very experienced, though, wandering monsters no longer serve this last purpose. If the DM runs them exactly as they come up on the Encounter Tables, monster encounters will be nothing but boring delays or (at best) comic relief.

Therefore, when the PCs are high level, the DM needs to think briefly about every random encounter and decide how the PCs' experience levels affect things. He or she should discard (that is, not play) encounters that would be nothing but dull combats and keep the encounters that have other purposes. To that end there are essentially three types of encounters the DM can consider running.

For example, there's nothing wrong with comic relief encounters as long as they're deliberately run with that intent. For example, a group of well-played bugbears blundering into a group of high-level PCs can provide a lot of humor. But recurring encounters along the same lines will, after a short while, wear very thin.

Then, there are tactical encounters. A large group of lower level monsters who have a superior knowledge of the terrain, good tactics, traps, and the advantage of surprise can challenge (or at least delay) high-level characters.

There are also respectful avoidance encounters. Word of a high-level party's power will certainly circulate in any dungeon or wilderness setting, along with descriptions of the individuals involved; weaker monsters will watch for and avoid these dangerous characters. When surprise encounters occur, the low-level monsters will automatically opt to preferably evade the PCs or to talk with them; such monsters would attack the PCs only under the rarest situations. Respectful avoidance encounters help reinforce to the PCs that they're more powerful and influential characters now—and it's a boost to their egos.

To reflect the powers of high-level characters, the DM may also alter the monsters' morale (described in the next chapter). If the PCs demon-

strate fierce magic or combat abilities, the monsters might decide to retreat or reconsider their position.

It's a mistake simply to change the wandering monster encounter tables so that only tough monsters appear. First because it's not very logical (the PCs will wonder where all the lesser creatures went), and second because it's frustrating to the PCs (who will assume, correctly, that it doesn't matter how strong they become because the DM will just increase the power of every monster in the world to compensate for them).

None of this means that the DM should entirely get rid of encounters with less-powerful monsters. For instance, when a weak monster serves as a clue to a dangerous but an as yet undiscovered situation or is an interesting and entertaining role-playing opportunity, the monster serves a definite purpose and should be kept.

## Evasion and Pursuit

When two groups encounter one another, one or both may decide to evade the other, or one group may decide to pursue the evading group. This means that, as soon as the groups spot one another, the evading group turns and runs, trying to get out of the pursuers' sight. Time is measured in rounds for as long as the chase occurs. The side running away is "evading," and the other chasing is "in pursuit." The Evasion Checklist on page 99 gives a step-by-step procedure for handling evasion and pursuit.

## Definitions

The terms used in the Evasion Checklist are defined in the following subsections and are presented in the order that they are most likely to occur.

### Contact

Contact occurs when the two parties encounter one another, as per the earlier encounter rules. They do not have to be near one another, only within visual range. When the encounter occurs, the DM determines the encounter distance and the parties' relative states of surprise.

### Decision to Evade

In an encounter, if one group surprises another (but is not itself surprised), it may automatically evade the surprised group by turning away and moving off at another direction at run-

ning speed for one round. The nonsurprised group has enough time to get clear of the area before the surprised group can recover enough to give chase. In fact, if the surprised party didn't detect the nonsurprised party, the surprised party will never know that it has just been through an encounter.

### Decision to Pursue

If neither party in an encounter was surprised and one party took off in an attempt to evade, the other party must now decide whether to pursue. Player characters decide for their own reasons whether to give chase. Monsters and NPCs make a morale check (described in the next chapter). If the NPC group contains different types of monsters, use the morale check of the monster that leads the group. If the monsters/NPCs successfully make the morale check, they give chase; if they fail, they let the PCs go and do not pursue.

### Attempt to Evade

If neither group was surprised (or if both were) and one group wishes to try evasion, the DM rolls on the Evasion Table. Find the size of the party and compare it to the number of creatures encountered. This gives the percentage chance that the evasion will be successful. If a large party breaks up into small parties, roll for each small party separately; in this way, some parties could evade while others could be caught.

**Example:** A PC party of eight characters runs into a scouting party of 12 orcs. Comparing the "Party Size 5-12" entry to the "Number of Monsters Encountered 9+" line, the PCs have a 70% chance to evade the orcs. The DM rolls a d100; on a 01-70, the PCs have successfully evaded the monsters, and on a 71-00, the monsters successfully pursue the characters.

The DM may adjust evasion chances for terrain, differences in speed, and other factors as noted in the Evasion Table. For example, woods might add a 25% chance to evade the monsters. If monsters are familiar with an area, they may be able to evade pursuers by rapidly turning corners, closing doors behind them, and so forth. If one group can move at least twice as fast as the other, the faster group adjusts the chances of evasion by 25% in its favor (that is, if the faster group is pursuing, it subtracts 25% from the evaders' evasion chance, and if the faster group is evading, it adds 25% to its evasion chance). If the pursuing group has sent out small groups of scouts, evasion is made more difficult (a -10% penalty is applied to the evasion chance).

**Important Note:** Regardless of the number of evasion penalties, the evading group always has at least a 5% chance to evade.

### Pursuit Continues

If the first evasion attempt was unsuccessful, the chase is on. Movement is carried out at run-

### Evasion Checklist

1. Contact: The two parties encounter one another.
2. Decision to Evade: One party decides to evade. If the evading party is not surprised and the other party is surprised, evasion is automatically successful; go to Step 6. If the other party is not surprised, go to Step 2.
3. Decision to Pursue: The other party decides whether to pursue. The PCs decide for themselves; monsters must make a morale check (defined in Chapter 8). On a successful morale check, the monsters give chase (go to Step 4). On an unsuccessful morale check, the monsters do not chase (go to Step 6).
4. Attempt to Evade: The DM rolls on the Evasion Table. If the PCs succeed, they have evaded the pursuers (go to Step 6). If they fail, pursuit continues (Step 5).
5. Pursuit Continues: Movement is measured in rounds and conducted at running speed; both sides roll 1d6 for initiative once per round; the side with the higher roll moves first each round. The chase continues until one of the following happens:
   1. The pursuers decide to give up. Monsters must make a new morale check every five rounds and give up the chase if they fail the check. Go to Step 6.
   2. The evading party is caught by the pursuers (because of superior speed or terrain obstacles). Combat occurs; go to the Combat Checklist in Chapter 8.
   3. The evading party escapes (by using magic spells or by finally making a successful evasion roll on the Evasion Table when terrain and circumstances warrant). Go to Step 6.
6. Regain Bearings: Evaders rest and determine where they now are.

ning speed, and time is measured in rounds. As though this were combat, each side rolls initiative once per round, with the two sides taking movement in initiative order. The chase will continue until one of the following events occurs.

*The pursuers decide to give up the chase.* PCs decide whether or not to keep chasing for their own reasons; monsters and NPCs, on the other hand, make a new morale check every five rounds, with failure indicating that they have given up the chase.

*The pursuers catch up to the evaders.* This can happen for one of a number of reasons. If the pursuers end one round having caught up to the evaders (the DM should be keeping track of their relative positions to determine this) and then win initiative the next round, they can attack, forcing the evaders to turn and fight. Or the evaders could run into some obstacle that prevents them from continuing (a sheer cliff face, a dead-end hallway, a magically locked door, another party of enemies, and so on). In these situations, combat usually results, though the evaders might choose to surrender instead.

*The evaders escape.* There are a number of ways evaders can escape their pursuers, including the following:

- Evaders can, if time permits, cast a spell that will allow them to get away. For example, they might cast a *teleport* spell to whisk the party to safety; a *pass wall* spell to get them somewhere inaccessible (followed by a *dispel magic* to cancel the *pass wall* so that the pursuers cannot follow); or a *wall of iron* spell to forestall pursuit long enough for the evaders to get away.

- If possible, evaders can run far enough ahead of the pursuers so that they are temporarily out of vision range when they reach an area of difficult terrain (for example, thick woods, a long dungeon corridor riddled with doors and side passages, etc.). In such cases, the DM would again roll on the Evasion Table for the evaders, and success would mean that the pursuers fail to follow their tracks.

## Chapter 7: Encounters and Evasion

• Evaders can drop goods that the monsters might want; a hungry monster might want meat rations, for example, while a vampire might be more content with magical treasures. In these cases, the DM rolls 1d6 *if he* or she feels that the item dropped is indeed appealing to the monster. On a 1-3, the monster stops to consume (or retrieve) the proffered goods and is delayed long enough for the evaders to get away.

### Regain Bearings

If the evaders do get away, they need to rest from their exertions and regain their bearings—that is, determine where they now are.

For every round the chase lasted, the evaders moved at full running speed in directions chosen or assumed by the DM. They didn't have time to

consult their map, and the DM should enforce this fact rigorously. If their movement carried them into areas they already knew or had mapped, they're fine. But, at the DM's discretion, their attempts at evasion could have carried them deep into unknown territory (such as wilderness off the posted roads and trails or unexplored dungeon levels), and now the characters are lost; they'll have to explore their way back to the areas they know.

### Evasion at Sea

Ships meeting at sea may wish to evade one another. To determine one ship's chance of eluding another ship, consult the Ship Evasion Table.

#### Ship Evasion Table

| Evading Ship's Speed (per round) | Chance of Evasion |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Faster than pursuer              | 80%               |
| 0'-30' slower                    | 50%               |
| 31'-60' slower                   | 40%               |
| 61'-90' slower                   | 35%               |
| 91'-120' slower                  | 25%               |
| 121' + slower                    | 10%               |

If evasion is successful, the pursuer loses sight of its prey and cannot find it again or attack it that day. A ship can evade its pursuer by sailing into a baffling archipelago, heading into a concealing fog, hiding itself in a cove and ducking out once the pursuers are past, and so forth.

If the evasion is not successful, the pursuer starts at a distance of 300 yards on a clear day. (At the DM's discretion, if the weather is impairing vision, the pursuer may start closer.) The pursuing ship closes in.

If the pursuer's speed is 0'-30' per round greater than the evader (or actually slower), the rate of closing is 10 yards per round. If the difference is greater than 30' per round, the pursuer closes in at its normal movement rate.

A slower vessel can close in on a faster one by virtue of superior sailing. If the evading ship missed its roll for evasion on the Ship Evasion Table yet it is faster than the pursuing ship, this means that the pursuer is sailing much more effectively than the evader.

If the DM is using the optional general skills rules, he or she can roll the two captains' Piloting skills in competition with one another. If the evading ship's captain rolls his skill better, he evades pursuit; if the pursuer rolls his better, he is able to close at the rates described above.

### Balancing Encounters (Optional)

When the DM is uncertain as to whether an encounter is a fair challenge, he or she can use the following system to make that determination. This optional rule gives a fairly accurate estimate of an encounter's impact on a PCs' party. Although this system is too involved to use with most random encounters, it is useful for prepared encounters. However, the DM is never required to use it, and no other rules in the D&D® game depend on its use.

The system makes the following assumptions:

- *The PC party is composed of a normal mix of character classes who are adequately equipped (with both gear and magic). Review any special abilities of this encounter's monster; if it has abilities that no member of the party can withstand, this encounter is too tough for them.*

- *The monster is encountered in a normal melee. If the monster is waiting in ambush or has special weapons or traps, the DM should treat the encounter as one level tougher than the calculations show.*

- *The monsters encountered are all the same type. If a mixed group of monsters is encountered, make sure the total of the monsters' adjusted Hit Dice falls within the desired range. If the monsters are mounted, add only half the HD of the mount or rider, whichever is weaker, as ad-*

# Chapter 7: Encounters and Evasion

ditions to the adjusted Hit Dice of the larger HD of the mount or rider.

• *The Total Party Level (TPL) is equivalent to the adjusted Hit Dice value of the monster.* The TPL (described and calculated below) is not adjusted for magical or special abilities. If the DM believes special abilities will play a major role in the encounter (for example, the entire party is made up of 18th level spellcasters), the DM will need to add power bonuses, as described below, to the TPL.

• *The party is at full strength.* The DM may adjust the TPL downward when the party is not at full strength, as discussed below.

## Balancing Encounters Checklist

Follow these three steps to determine the impact of an encounter:

1. Determine the TPL (Total Party Level) of the PC party.
2. Determine the Individual Adjusted Hit Dice of the Monsters.
3. Determine the type of challenge faced.

## Definitions

The terms used in the Balancing Encounters Checklist are defined here and presented in the order of procedure.

### Determine the TPL

The Total Party Level (TPL) is the sum of the experience levels of all the characters in the party. If the party consists of six 10th level characters, the TPL is  $60 (6 imes 10)$ .

The DM can adjust the TPL downward if the party is not at full strength. If a character has taken at least 1 hit point of damage for every experience level he has (that is, an 8th level character has taken 8 or more hit points of damage), treat him as being one experience level less than he is.

If he has taken at least 2 hit points of damage for every level he has (in this case, 16 hit points of damage), treat him as being two levels less than he is. For the TPL figure, damage can reduce a character to no less than  $1/2$  (round down) his actual experience level.

*Example:* An 8th level fighter with 40 hit points has taken 24 hit points in damage. This is 3 hit points for every experience level he has, so he is rated as being a 5th level fighter ( $8 - 3 = 5$ ) for the Total Party Level.

### Determine the Individual Adjusted Hit Dice of the Monsters

The Individual Adjusted Hit Dice figure represents the monster's overall effectiveness; it's a combination of its Hit Dice and special abilities.

To find the Individual Adjusted Hit Dice, take the creature's Hit Dice. If there are additions to the Hit Dice, divide additional hit points by five, round up, and add the result to the number of Hit Dice. For example, a creature with  $4 + 3$  HD would count as 5 HD.

If there are any subtractions from the Hit Dice, subtract  $1/2$  HD per 2 points subtracted. For example, a creature with 1-1 HD would count as  $1/2$  HD.

Then add half of the original Hit Dice figure for each power bonus. Power bonuses include:

• Each asterisk next to a monster's hit dice.

• Special NPC abilities. For NPC parties, award a power bonus for each of the following conditions: 1) Everyone in the party has +2 weapons or better; and 2) There are spellcasters in the party. (Take the highest level of spells that may be cast, divide by two, then divide that result by the number of characters in the party, rounding up; the result is the power bonus added to the Individual Adjusted Hit Dice figure of every character in the party.)

*Example:* A monster's description (from Chapter 14) says "HD 9\*\*." For each asterisk, add in half the creature's basic HD; therefore, each asterisk is worth  $+4$  12 HD to this creature's rating, and its Individual Adjusted Hit Dice is 18.

*Example:* An NPC party has four members; one can cast spells up to 8th level. The party's power bonus equals  $1/4$  (8 levels / 2 / 4 members = 1/4), or 1 power bonus to everyone in the party.

If more than one monster is present in the encounter, add their Individual Adjusted Hit Dice figures together.

### Determine the Challenge

The challenge of an encounter is expressed as a percentage number. To find that number, divide the combined Individual Adjusted Hit Dice of the monsters by the TPL of the player character party. Remember that a number such as "5" actually translates into percentile form as "50%," as shown in the Challenge Percentage Table, found below.

When a DM is using the balancing encounters optional rule, he or she should decide which level of challenge the encounter should be (see the Encounter Challenge Table). Then the DM can multiply the TPL by the challenge percentage (from the Challenge Percentable Table) to get a range of Hit Dice.

Divide the highest number obtained by the adjusted monster Hit Dice to determine how many monsters should be present in the encounter. The DM can use any fraction to make one monster a larger leader or can treat a fraction as a youngster.

When checking the impact of an encounter, the DM can take the total adjusted monster Hit Dice and divide by the TPL  $x$  100 to determine the percentage. Then, he or she can look up the result in the challenge levels as listed in the Encounter Challenge Table.

### Challenge Percentage Table

| Number | Percentage |
|--------|------------|
| .1     | 10%        |
| .2     | 20%        |
| .3     | 30%        |
| .4     | 40%        |
| .5     | 50%        |
| .6     | 60%        |
| .7     | 70%        |
| .8     | 80%        |
| .9     | 90%        |
| 1.0    | 100%       |

## Encounter Challenge Table

| Adj. HD of TPL | Challenge Level     |
|----------------|---------------------|
| 110% +         | Extremely dangerous |
| 90-110%        | Risky               |
| 70-90%         | Major               |
| 50-70%         | Challenging         |
| 30-50%         | Good fight          |
| 20-30%         | Distruction         |
| 10-20%         | Minor               |
| 1-10%          | Too easy            |

The terms presented in the Encounter Challenge Table are defined in the following text and are listed in the order of challenge.

**Extremely Dangerous:** This encounter is a killer. If the PCs do not retreat or flee, they will probably be defeated and may die. This type of encounter is usually used for "no win" situations when the DM wants it obvious that the players cannot beat the monsters in a fight.

**Risky:** The monsters are equal to the party and there is an even chance that either side may win. This encounter may require many of the party's resources, and some members may die. Risky-encounters are sometimes used for the grand finale to a quest.

**Major:** This type of encounter is usually used as the main fight or climax of an adventure. If an adventure has little fighting, the DM may want to include one or two of these encounters.

**Challenging:** This encounter will challenge a party's might, but the party has the odds in its favor if the encounter is played well. If the adventure is short, three to five of these encounters may be used.

**Good Fight:** This is the most common level of encounter and can make up half of an adventure. A good fight may also include tough random encounters.

**Distruction:** This is a smaller encounter that will cost the party some hit points but should be easy to overcome. This level should be used when there are many encounters and the party has little chance to recover from previous ones.

**Minor:** Most random encounters should be of this level. Often minor encounters are used to warn a party of something worse ahead.

**Too Easy:** An encounter that is too easy is best ignored or played for humor. It is not a real challenge unless the party is weaponless or injured.

## Reversing the Process

By finding the total Hit Dice of a group of monsters about to be encountered by a party (according to the encounter key), the impact of the encounter can be estimated in advance. If the DM sees that the likely result is not desirable, their numbers or hit points may be modified.

There are many good reasons for modifying existing details (often called "winging it"). If the party is critically injured, the DM might want to avoid killing characters. If the party has been remarkably unlucky in treasure finding during the adventure, the DM might want to add more, with a corresponding increase in danger.

# Chapter 8: Combat

When an encounter turns into a battle, the conflict is played out in *combat rounds*. Each combat round is ten seconds or game time. During a round, characters can do one thing: move, attack, cast a spell, drink a potion, or any other single action that a person can normally do in ten seconds. A character cannot do two things in a single round, such as run 20 feet and then attack. He would have to run 20 feet in one round, then attack in the next round.

Characters rarely stand solidly in one place and fight without moving from one position. When a character attacks, we assume that he is maneuvering for position. To reflect this limited movement, a character can move up to 5 feet while he is fighting. Maneuvering in this way does not count as an action during the round.

*Melee* refers to hand-to-hand combat only. *Battle* implies the use of hand-to-hand combat, missile combat, and spell combat used in combination. This chapter deals with all details of individual and party combat. Mass combat (between armies) is covered in Chapter 9.

## Order of Combat

Many of the encounter results from the last chapter referred to the Combat Sequence Checklist. The combat sequence is a checklist for the DM and covers every action possible within a combat round. Keep in mind that the sequence is a guideline—DMs should ignore it when common sense overrides the normal sequence.

### Combat Sequence Checklist

1. **Initiative:** Each side rolls 1d6 to determine initiative.
2. **First Side Goes:** The side that won the initiative acts first.
   1. **Morale (Optional):** Monsters and NPCs roll Morale Checks. Also, anyone who needs to make a saving throw vs. an ongoing effect does so now.
   2. **Movement:** Characters who choose to move do so now.
   3. **Missile Combat:** Characters using missile and thrown weapons make their attacks.
      1. They choose their **targets**.
      2. They make their attack **rolls**.
      3. They roll damage for any successful hits.
   4. **Magic:** Characters using magic cast their spells.
      1. They choose their **targets**.
      2. Their targets roll saving throws if appropriate. §
      3. The DM applies the results.
   5. **Hand-to-Hand Combat:** Characters fighting hand-to-hand make their attacks.
      1. They choose their **targets**.
      2. They make their attack **rolls**.
      3. They roll damage for any successful hits.
   6. **Second Side Goes:** The side that lost the initiative acts now, performing the same five steps.
   7. **Special Results:** The DM announces any special results.

The phases for *initiative*, *morale*, *movement*, *missile combat*, *magic*, and *hand-to-hand combat* are described in detail later in this chapter, under their own headlines.

### Special Results

At the end of the round, the DM determines all results of "special actions": attempts to retreat, offers to surrender, resolution of special skills, etc. The DM may prefer to resolve some special results at other points in the combat round. For example, if a thief is trying to move silently, the DM can to resolve the success or failure of that skill during the movement phase of the round.

## Initiative

The first action in a combat round is to roll initiative. The initiative roll determines who gets to act first in combat.

## Group Initiative

The DM rolls 1d6 for the NPCs; one player rolls 1d6 for the player characters. The side that rolls the highest number acts first. In case of a tie, all action this round is simultaneous. However, even when initiative is simultaneous, the steps of the combat sequence occur in order.

The group that wins the initiative gets to act first. Note that the group that wins the initiative does *not* have to attack. The players and the DM should decide based on the circumstances whether the characters wish to talk, move around, run away, or attack.

Likewise, the monsters will decide, based on the situation they see—and their ability to interpret it, and their customary behavior—what they will do when they win initiative. Some will have no interest in fighting. Some, territorial, will warn the PCs away from their lairs but not attack unless they are intruded upon. Some will trade or exchange information; some will merely attack.

### Initiative and Multiple Attacks

If a monster that wins initiative has more than one attack, it will get *all* of its attacks before the player characters can act. If a high level character with multiple attacks wins the initiative, he gets to make all his attacks before the other side gets to move.

### Ties

If each side rolls the same number for initiative, then all the action happens at once; the actions are "simultaneous," and neither side wins the initiative.

In a round where things are happening simultaneously, every character and monster who chose to attack gets to roll all his attacks. Even if one character's attacks killed an opponent, the opponent gets to roll his attacks because they're taking place simultaneously.

Characters who chose to run will do so. If another character chose to attack the runner, he gets to make his attack. If the attack misses or fails to kill the runner, the runner gets his full movement.

Characters who chose to talk get a few words into what they meant to say before violence erupts (assuming that violence does erupt; perhaps everyone wanted to talk!). All the characters who decided to attack or run do so, and then the character who chose to talk can attack or run as he chose . . . after everyone else has gone.

## Individual Initiative (Optional)

Every player rolls 1d6 for his character; the DM rolls a separate 1d6 for each monster or NPC. High rolls go first in the round. In case of a tie, the tied parties roll again, high roll going first, until all ties are resolved.

Some DMs may prefer to use "individual initiative." With this sort of initiative, every player rolls 1d6 for his own character, and the DM rolls 1d6 for every monster or NPC involved in the encounter. It otherwise operates the same way as normal initiative. Even when a DM prefers group initiative, he may prefer to use individual initiative in combat rounds where the two sides tied their group initiative roll.

### Dexterity Adjustments (Optional)

At the DM's option, a character's Dexterity can modify his individual initiative roll, according to the Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores Table on page 9. A character's bonus to individual initiative does not affect the party's roll in group initiative.

## Morale (Optional)

DMs are free to ignore this rule entirely, and they can gauge the morale based on the situation, the nature of the creature involved, and any other factors they deem as relevant. The morale check is supposed to be a convenience for the DM, to give him a quick way to decide how creatures react; it's not a straight-jacket to keep him from role-playing a character the way he sees that character behaving.

DM rolls 2d6 against creature's morale score (found in monster descriptions). If 2d6 roll is equal to or less than morale score, creature pursues combat; otherwise, it avoids combat. Only NPCs and monsters roll morale; PCs make their own decisions.

Morale is a measure of a creature's courage, loyalty, and high spirits. All monsters and NPCs have a morale number score which is used to determine their state of morale in bad situations.

Each creature in Chapter 14 will have an entry for morale. Good morale (a high number) indicates, in general, that a creature is stubborn and tenacious; it is willing to keep fighting in most bad situations. Bad morale (a low number) means that the creature is easily panicked, cowardly, or otherwise inclined to get away.

Morale is only a function of monsters and NPCs. Players always decide how their characters will face dangers; they do not roll morale.

## When to Check Morale

The DM never needs to check morale for a creature with a morale score of 2 or 12. A morale of 2 means that the creature always runs away from danger; it will not fight. A score of 12 means that the creature will always pursue combat and fight to the death, once it has begun to fight; it never gives up.

Creatures with morale scores from 3 to 11 need to make morale checks under the following circumstances:

- At the Start of an Evasion: When a group tries to evade encounters, the DM rolls to see if the creatures give chase.
- During a Chase: Every five combat rounds; success means that the creatures continue to give chase, and failure means they break off the chase.
- In Combat: When the creature is first hit, taking 1 or more hit points of damage.
- In Combat: When the creature is reduced to one-quarter (or less) of its starting hit points.
- In Combat: When the first death (on either side, PC or NPC/monster) takes place; the DM makes one morale roll for the remaining creatures to see if they wish to continue.
- In Combat: When half of the creatures are not free to act (because they are dead, asleep, controlled, etc.).
- In Combat: When the creature or NPC is subjected to a weapon master's Despair effect (as described in Chapter 5).
- At Any Time: When the creature or NPC is subjected to a magical item or spell that calls for a morale check. (Example: *drums of panic*, *reverse gravity* spell.)

### Morale Phase

Morale has its own phase in the combat sequence described at the start of the chapter. In this phase, monsters make their morale rolls for events that took place in the last combat round. Also in this phase, characters and monsters make their saving throws against ongoing effects of spells or conditions (such as stunning) that require them to make saving throws every round.

## How to Check Morale

Whenever the situation calls for a morale check the DM rolls 2d6. The morale score is listed in the monster description in Chapter 14.

If the result is *less than or equal to* the morale score, the creatures will pursue the fight.

If the result is *greater than* the creatures' morale score, the creatures will flee/avoid combat, call for a cease-fire, or surrender.

## Adjustments to the Morale Check

The DM may decide to adjust a morale check to reflect the combat's current circumstances. When you roll the 2d6 for the morale check, add the bonus to or subtract the penalty from the morale score itself—not the number rolled on the dice.

Here are some sample situations that can lead to adjustments to the morale check:

- Monsters have slain one or more PCs/

retainers but have lost none of their own members: +2 bonus.

- Monsters have slain one or more PCs/retainers and have lost one or more of their own members: +1 bonus.
- The PCs have been using a lot of magic against the monsters, and the monsters have no equivalent magic: —1 penalty.

The DM can adjust the morale check for whatever circumstances he deems appropriate, but total adjustments should never exceed a bonus of +2 or penalty of -2.

## Retainer Morale

A retainer's morale is determined by his employer's Charisma score. Consult the Charisma Adjustment Table in Chapter 1 on page 10. For example, on that table, if a character has a Charisma score of 18, his retainers will have morale scores of 10. Only check a retainer's morale during an adventure when the following occurs:

- In Combat: If the retainer's employer orders the retainer into danger while the employer remains in safer surroundings.
- In Combat: When the retainer is reduced to one-quarter (or less) of his starting hit points.
- In Combat: When the retainer is subjected to a weapon master's Despair effect (as described in Chapter 5).
- At Any Time: When the retainer is subjected to a magical item or spell that calls for a morale check. (Example: *drums of panic*, *reverse gravity* spell.)

## Deciding on Morale Scores

All monsters in this book have morale scores listed for them. All monsters and NPC's appearing in D&D® game supplements and adventures should also have morale scores listed for them.

Occasionally, though, it happens that a monster or NPC is mentioned without a morale score. Also, whenever you create a new NPC or monster, you have to decide what its morale score is.

There are two easy ways to do this.

First, you can simply decide on a score based on what you know about the NPC/creature; compare the personality of that creature to the Morale Scores table, and choose a morale score that fits the creature.

Morale Scores Table

| Type of Personality                | Morale Score Range |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Abjectly cowardly                  | 2                  |
| Always frightened or very cautious | 3-5                |
| Unmotivated                        | 6                  |
| Disinterested                      | 7                  |
| Normal                             | 8                  |
| Brave, determined, or stubborn     | 9-11               |
| Suicidally brave or berserk        | 12                 |

Second, if you have no clues as to the creature's personality or motivations, just roll 2d6. The result is the creature's morale score.

## Movement

You learned about movement in Chapter 6. Here are some additional details:

- Encounter Speed: A character or monster may move his full encounter speed movement (1/3 normal movement in one round) and still make his attacks this round.
- Running Speed: A character or monster may move his full running speed movement (3<sup>1/3</sup> normal movement) this round if he is not already engaged in combat but cannot attack if he does so.
- Normal Speed: A character's normal speed is never used during the combat sequence.

Simple, quick actions such as drawing a new weapon do not subtract from a character's movement score; the DM may choose to deduct some of a character's movement for the round if he performs any more complicated maneuvers. Standing up after a fall, however, does count as an action in a combat round.

## Combat Maneuvers

In the missile combat, magic, and hand-to-hand combat phases, characters choose *maneuvers* to perform. The Combat Maneuvers Table shows all normal combat maneuvers in the order in which they occur within a combat round.

A character can only perform *one* of the maneuvers per round unless he has the multiple attacks option; see the description for that maneuver, below.

## Description of Maneuvers

Throw

A character can use any weapon that is thrown (daggers and hand axes, for instance). A successful hit will do the damage listed for the weapon. The character gets his Dexterity and magic bonuses to his attack roll and his Strength and magic bonus to any damage he inflicts. Targets must be in range (see the listing for weapon ranges in the Weapons table of Chapter 4). If a character has multiple attacks, he can throw a weapon for any attack he makes in a round.

Fire

A character uses any missile fire weapon (bows, crossbows, and slings, for instance) in combat. A successful hit will do the damage listed for the weapon. The character gets his Dexterity bonus to his attack roll. Targets must be in range of the weapon (see the listing for weapon ranges in the Weapons table of Chapter 4). A monster attacking with a ranged damage power (such as a dragon's breath) will use this maneuver in combat.

Cast Spell

A character casts a spell—from memory or from a scroll. A monster attacking with a magical power that doesn't qualify as a ranged damage attack or a hand-to-hand attack, such as a vampire's *charm*, will use this maneuver in combat.

Use Magical Item

A character with a nonweapon magical item can use it with this maneuver. This is the maneuver for use of most nonweapon magical items (potions, wands, staves, rods, rings, and miscel-

lanes magical items) and for the inoffensive magic powers of other magical items (for instance, an enchanted sword's *detect evil* power).

### Attack

A character attacks with any hand-to-hand weapon. A successful hit inflicts the weapon's standard damage on the target. The character gets to add his Strength and magic bonuses to both his attack roll and the damage he does with his weapon. If a character has the multiple attacks maneuver, he may choose this maneuver for any attack he makes in a round.

### Fighting Withdrawal

A character can only perform this maneuver when he begins his combat round in hand-to-hand combat with an enemy. With this maneuver, the character backs away from his enemy at a rate of 5' per round. He makes no attack unless his enemies follow him *later in the same combat round, on the enemies' own movement phase*. If they do, he can make his attack *at the end of the enemies' movement phase*, before the enemies begin their own attacks. The character's attack is the same as a normal attack. If he is not in hand-to-hand combat with his enemy when his movement phase comes around in the next round, he can go to running speed that next round.

### Retreat

A character can only perform this maneuver when he begins his combat round in hand-to-hand combat with an enemy. The character runs away from his enemy at greater than half his encounter speed, up to his full encounter speed. He forfeits the armor class bonus of his shield. Any enemy attacking him later in the combat round (that is, either an enemy who followed him during the enemies' movement phase or an enemy attacking with a ranged weapon) receives a +2 attack roll bonus this round. This is the same +2 that characters normally get for attacking from behind (see the Attack Roll Modifiers Table on page 108).

If the character is not in hand-to-hand combat with his enemy when his movement phase comes up in the next round, he can go to running speed that next round.

### Lance Attack

If a character is on a riding steed (such as a horse) and is using a lance, he can perform the

lance attack if his mount runs (flies, swims) for 20 yards or more toward the fighter's target.

The character gets his Strength and magic adjustments to the attack roll and damage with the lance attack maneuver. The lance, if it hits, will inflict *double damage* with a successful hit—roll the damage for the lance, multiply the result by 2, and then apply all appropriate adjustments. Without enough room to charge—if the mount moves less than 20 yards or is stationary—the lance does normal damage only.

Fighters, dwarves and elves can use a lance attack, but no other character class can do so. If a character has the multiple attacks maneuver, he may choose the lance attack maneuver for any attack he makes in a round. However, he cannot hit the same target time after time; he must choose a new target along his mount's line of movement for each attack, and therefore he must be capable of hitting *each target* with an attack roll of 2.

### Set Spear vs. Charge

A character on foot and carrying a spear, pike, sword shield, or lance can set the weapon vs. a charge. A charge is when a monster charges the character—that is, runs toward him for 20 or more yards before its attack. A character can also set his spear vs. another character's lance attack against him.

When the character "sets vs. charge," he holds the weapon firm, braced against the ground and toward the onrushing enemy. The character gets his Strength and magic adjustments to his attack and damage rolls. If the character's attack hits, he inflicts *double damage* on his target, adding damage adjustments after doubling.

The character must declare a set spear vs. charge *before* he is in hand-to-hand combat with the creature charging him. For example, if the character's party wins initiative in the round and the character suspects the monster will charge, he could declare his set spear vs. charge maneuver. Likewise, the characters might see a group of charging monsters several rounds before they arrive, and set their spears against the charge one or more rounds ahead of time.

Normally, the character makes his attack on the monster's movement phase, when the monster first moves within range of the weapon. If his attack hits and kills the monster, the monster cannot hurt him in return. If his attack fails to

kill the monster, the monster will be able to attack on its own hand-to-hand combat phase of the combat sequence.

### Multiple Attacks

This is a Fighter Combat Option maneuver, first available at 12th level to human fighters, at other experience point totals to demihumans (see their experience tables).

In melee combat, if the fighter can hit his opponent with an attack roll of 2 (modified by all bonuses), he can make two attacks per round against that target (three per round at level 24, four per round at level 36).

Each attack of a multiple attacks maneuver can be a throw, attack, lance attack, or disarm. A character can mix and match his maneuvers; for instance, a character with three attacks per round could perform an attack, disarm, attack combination against his foe, or throw three knives instead of one. This maneuver applies to ideal circumstances, and the character can use movement or some other action instead of another attack.

### Smash

This is a Fighter Combat Option maneuver, first available at 9th level to fighters and mystics, and at other experience point totals to demihumans (see their experience tables). With this hand-to-hand maneuver, the character automatically loses initiative and takes a -5 penalty to the attack roll (he still gets his Strength and magic adjustments to his attack roll).

If attack hits, the character adds his Strength bonus, magic bonuses, and his *entire Strength score* to his weapon's normal damage.

For example, a Strength 17 fighter (+2 to attack and damage) using a *sword* +2 (+2 to attack, 1d8 + 2 damage) would perform a smash this way: He rolls to hit with a net penalty of -1 (+2 + 2-5). If he hits, he rolls 1d8 + 21 (+2 + 2 + 2) for damage!

### Parry

This is a Fighter Combat Option maneuver, first available at 9th level to fighters and mystics, and at other experience point totals to demihumans (see their experience tables). With this maneuver, the fighter does not make any attack roll. Instead, he blocks incoming attacks for the entire combat round; all enemies attacking him suffer a -4 penalty to hit him with melee and thrown (but not missile) weapons.

### Disarm

This is a Fighter Combat Option maneuver, first available at 9th level to fighters and mystics, and at other experience point totals to demihumans (see their experience tables).

This maneuver can only be used when the fighter attacks a weapon-using opponent. The fighter gets his normal Strength and magic adjustments to his attack roll. If he hits, he inflicts no damage. Instead, the victim rolls 1d20, minus his Dexterity bonuses, plus his attacker's Dexterity bonuses. If the final roll is greater than the victim's Dexterity score, the victim drops his weapon.

*Example:* Sir Hogier is fighting a warrior whom he intends to take alive. The warrior is AC 0, and has a Dexterity of 17; Sir Hogier is 20th level, with the bonuses from a Strength of 16 and a +2 sword. Hogier has a Dexterity of 12. Hogier needs to roll a 7 to hit AC0. He rolls a 6, but adds his bonuses from Strength and sword to

get a 10; he has hit.

Now, the victim rolls 1d20. He rolls a 15. He subtracts his own Dexterity bonus ( $a + 1$ , from his Dexterity of 13), for a result of 14. Sir Hogier, with a Dexterity of 12, has no Dexterity bonus to add. The final result is a 14, which is more than the victim's Dexterity of 13. The disarm attempt has succeeded.

Once disarmed, the victim may either switch weapons (suffering only the loss of initiative for the next round), or he may try to *retrieve* the weapon. When retrieving a weapon, a victim must retreat to grab the dropped weapon.

## Attack Rolls Table (All Characters)

The Attack Rolls Table: All Characters on page 106 is used when characters attack targets. It is used both for PCs and for NPCs.

### Expanding the Attack Rolls Table

Attack rolls are only given for targets of AC 19 through AC -20, but there are no real upper or lower limits—the numbers may be extrapolated indefinitely to the right or left. Notice that any number above 10 that ends in a 0 (20, 30, etc.) is repeated five times before the table moves on to the next number.

The numbers 2 and 10 also repeats five times, after which the numbers drop normally. Instead of going into negative numbers, each zero or less has a dagger (t) and is explained in the notes.

Note that an unadjusted roll of 1 should always miss. A natural roll of 20 should always hit.

## The Attack Roll

### Attack Roll Checklist: All Characters

1. The attacker looks on the Attack Rolls Table: All Characters and finds the armor class of his target. The number given on the table is the number he needs to achieve with his roll and bonuses to hit his target.
   1. **Weapon Mastery Option:** Because they help determine how often a character can use multiple attacks, weapon mastery attack bonuses are applied to the *character's attack roll*. If a character needs to roll an 18 to hit someone but he has a +2 bonus for weapon mastery, he actually needs a 16 for a successful attack (optional).
   2. The victim's armor class may be modified by partial exposure if the attacker is using a missile weapon and the victim is only exposed for part of a round. See "Cover Adjustments" later in this chapter (optional).
2. The attacker rolls 1d20.
3. The attacker adds pertinent bonuses to his 1d20 roll. Pertinent bonuses include:
   1. Strength adjustment, for melee attacks,
   2. Dexterity adjustment, for missile or thrown attacks,
   3. Magic bonuses, either from spells affecting the character or magical weapons being used.
4. The attacker subtracts pertinent penalties from his 1d20 roll. Pertinent penalties include:
   1. Cover, if missile attack and the target is partially concealed (optional),
   2. *Magical curses*, if the curse affects combat abilities and attack rolls.
5. If the result of the modified 1d20 roll equals or exceeds the number on the Attack Rolls Table: All Characters, the attacker has hit his target. Important Note: An unadjusted (natural) roll of 1 always misses. An unadjusted (natural) roll of 20 always hits, if it is possible for the attack to hit the target.
6. If the result was a hit, the attacker now rolls-damage. First, he rolls the damage listed for the weapon or attack.
7. Adjust the roll with any multipliers, such as a thief's Backstab ability, or a charge bonus.
8. Then, the attacker adds in any pertinent bonuses to damage. Pertinent bonuses include:
   1. Strength adjustments (added to melee attacks).
   2. Magic bonuses (from magic weapons or magic spells affecting the character),
   3. The attacker's entire Strength score is added to the damage if he performed a smash maneuver.
9. The sum of the number rolled on the damage dice and the pertinent bonuses is the amount of damage the victim takes.

Note\* Misses only on a natural 1. Add the numbers shown to the total damage done by the attack.Extra Damage (Optional)Whenever the number needed to hit is a zero or less, a dagger appears next to it on the tables. This indicates that the attack hits unless a natural 1 is rolled, and the attack inflicts additional damage equal to the number with the dagger. Thus, if a character needs a "71" on the table to hit, he will automatically hit that armor class unless he rolls a natural 1; if he does hit, he inflicts 7 extra points of damage to his target. If this rule is not used, treat all Attack Rolls Table: All Characters entries of 1 and those with a dagger as a 2.

THACOThe term "THACO" stands for "To Hit Armor Class 0." If someone needs to roll a 7—not counting any of his individual bonuses or penalties—to hit an armor class of 0, we say that he has a THACO of 7.

Many character and monster descriptions you'll find in published adventures will list the individual's THACO. This is a convenience for you, since you can quickly calculate a character's chance to hit *any* armor class from his THACO.

When a target's AC is *worse than* 0 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.), you subtract that AC from his THACO. Likewise, when a target's AC is *better than* 0 (i.e., -1, -2, etc.), you subtract the AC from the THACO score—but remember that subtracting negative numbers is the same as adding positive numbers.

*Example:* Sinesstros is a 13th level fighter. His THACO from the table is an 11. To hit an AC of 0, he needs to roll an 11. He wants to hit an opponent with an AC of 5. We subtract 5 from the 11 he needs for the higher AC. The result: 6. He needs to roll a 6 to hit AC 5.

On the other hand, let's say he's attacking someone with an AC of -4. We subtract the AC from the THACO number:  $11 - (-4) = 11 + 4 = 15$ . He needs a 15 to hit AC -4.

Attack Rolls Table (All Monsters)Monsters don't use the same attack rolls table as do characters; they use the Attack Rolls Table: All Monsters on page 107.

Note that this table continues, just as the player characters' Attack Rolls Table continues. There is no limit to possible armor classes.

Attack Roll ModifiersSome modifiers to the attack roll that are used in many combat situations are listed in the following table.

Attack Roll Modifiers Table

| Circumstance               | Attack Roll Modifier |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Attacking from behind      | +2 bonus*            |
| Attacker can't see target  | -4 penalty           |
| Larger than man-sized      |                      |
| monster attacks halfing    | -1 penalty           |
| Target exhausted           | +2 bonus             |
| Attacker exhausted         | -2 penalty           |
| * Ignore defender's shield |                      |

Characters may become exhausted from running or overexertion, as described in Chapter 7.

Missile CombatMissile Combat PhaseIn the missile combat phase of the combat sequence, each character who has chosen to use a missile or thrown weapon now chooses his target, rolls to hit that target, and (if his roll is a success) rolls damage for his attack. The victim, if hit, applies results immediately. If the attack kills or stuns the victim, the victim will not be able to act later in the round.

Missile Adjustments to HitEach of the factors in the Missile Adjustments to Hit Checklist can provide a bonus or penalty to the attack roll when using missile or thrown weapons.

Missile Adjustments to Hit Checklist

1. **Dexterity:** Dex 3, -3; Dex 4-5, -2; Dex 6-8, -1; Dex 13-15, +1; Dex 16-17, +2; Dex 18, +3
2. **Range:** Weapon Short Range, +1; Weapon Medium Range, no adjustment; Weapon Long Range, -1
3. **Cover:** (See text below)
4. **Magic:** Adjustments according to spell or effect used

Dexterity AdjustmentsInclude any bonuses or penalties to your attack roll due to high or low Dexterity. *You* may have an adjustment from -3 to +3, depending on your Dexterity score.

Range AdjustmentsEvery missile or thrown weapon in the game is rated in terms of its range—how far away it may be cast to hit a target. If the range is *short*, it's easier for a character to hit his target; add 1 to the attack roll. For instance, if a character is throwing a net at a target six feet away, that's within the 10' short range, and a +1 on the attack roll. If you don't know for sure that you're at short range, after you've rolled to hit, ask the DM if you got the +1 bonus on the attack.

If the distance to the target is greater than the short range number but not greater than the medium range number, the range is *medium*. *Your* character gets no adjustment for range.

If the distance to the target is greater than the medium range number but equal to or less than the long range number, the range is *long*. It's a more difficult shot; your character must subtract 1 from his attack roll.

Cover AdjustmentsThe enemy may be harder to hit because it is hiding behind something; this is called *cover*. A character can gain the advantage of cover by hiding behind a table or chair, or a tree or boulder outdoors. *A shield does not provide cover for purposes of this rule*; the -1 to AC bonus is the only adjustment the shield provides.

If a target is behind cover, the DM should mention the fact to the players; he will apply penalties to the attack rolls. The DM does not have to tell his players precisely how severe the attack roll penalties are. The DM determines

each shot's penalties; they range from -1 for nominal soft cover to -6 for 3/4 hard cover.

On the Target Cover Table, the fractions represent how much of the target is behind cover. "Soft" means that missile attacks easily penetrate the cover, whose value is mainly to hide the target (bushes, tapestries, etc.). "Hard" means that the cover can often deflect or stop the missile attacks (boulders, heavy oaken tables, doors, and so forth).

Target Cover Table

| Target has: | Soft Cover | Hard Cover |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1/4 cover   | -1         | -2         |
| 1/2 cover   | -2         | -4         |
| 3/4 cover   | -3         | -6         |
| Full cover  | -4         | Can't hit  |

Magic AdjustmentsIf your character is under the effects of a magic spell that helps his chances to hit, that help—which is normally a bonus to his attack roll—is applied here. Bonuses from such things as magical arrows also apply to the attack roll.

Missile Adjustments to DamageCharacters get their Strength adjustment to thrown weapon damage, but not to missile weapon damage. If a weapon has a magical bonus (an *arrow* +1), you also add the bonus to the damage the weapon does. An arrow does 1d6 points of damage; an *arrow* +1 does 1d6 + 1.

Targets Within 5'Missile attacks are not normally effective within a 5' range. If the target is within 5' and the attacker is using a missile fire device (bow, crossbow, etc.), the attack *automatically misses* unless the target cannot move. The target must be tied down, grabbed by another character, held by magic, or otherwise pinned, else the missile attack will fail.

Partial Targets (Optional)Sometimes a target is only exposed for part of a round (such as during a quick run between points of concealment). If so, the DM can use this rule to simulate the difficulty of hitting a target that is only briefly exposed to fire.

A combat round is ten seconds long. The DM should calculate, based on how he sees the situation, how long the target was exposed, then consult the table below for the target's defensive bonus. *The bonus applies both to armor class and saving throws*. In fact, if the attack is a spell that normally does not allow a saving throw, any defensive bonus from partial exposure gives the target a saving throw of 20.

SecondsExposed: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

DefenseBonus  
(+): 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

MagicMagic PhaseIn the magic phase of the combat sequence, each character who has chosen to cast a spell this round (who *can* cast a spell and hasn't already made a missile attack this round) now chooses his target. He makes an attack roll to hit that target if an attack roll is required for his spell. The target makes a saving throw if one is allowed or necessary. The target applies any damage, if any, immediately. As before, if the attack kills or stuns the victim, the victim will not be able to act later in the round.

Maximum Spell DamageThis rule was presented in Chapter 3, but is important enough to repeat here and elsewhere. *The maximum damage produced by any single spell is 20 dice, of the type of dice specified.*

Character Saving ThrowsThe player finds out what he's saving against (death ray, poison, magic wands, paralysis, turn to stone, dragon breath, rod, staff or spell). He cross-references his character level with the attack on the Saving Throws Table: All Characters and rolls 1d20. If he rolls or exceeds the number shown, he has successfully saved.

The bad effects of many magic spells can be diminished or eliminated altogether if the victim can make a saving throw.

To make a saving throw, the player finds out from the DM what sort of saving throw he should make (vs. death ray or poison, magic wands, paralysis or turn to stone, dragon breath, or rod, staff or spell).

If the magical attack doesn't *exactly* correspond to one of those categories, the DM should decide which type of saving throw column the attack most closely corresponds to. For example, a magical flame-thrower is similar to a dragon's fiery breath, so a character in the effect of one would make a saving throw vs. dragon breath.

The player cross-references his character's class and level with the column he's to roll on, and then rolls 1d20. If his die roll equals or exceeds the number shown, he has successfully saved.

Some spells, magical items and high Wisdom scores can improve some saving throws; whenever the player thinks his character has a bonus against a certain attack, he should remind the DM of this before rolling the saving throw.

Monster Saving ThrowsMonsters do not have a separate saving throws table. They use the same table as characters.

If a monster description in another publication does not have a "Saves As:" listing, here's a simple rule of thumb: Intelligent creatures save as fighters of equal experience level to the monsters' Hit Dice. A creature of animal intelligence or lower saves as a fighter whose experience level is half the monster's Hit Dice (round up). Thus a 9-HD monster of Intelligence 1 would save as a 5th level fighter.

## Hand-to-Hand Combat

### Hand-to-Hand Combat Phase

In the hand-to-hand combat phase of the combat sequence, each character who has chosen to make a hand-to-hand attack, and who has not yet either made a missile attack or cast a spell, can now attack. He chooses his target, rolls to hit, and (if the roll is a success) rolls damage for his attack. The victim, if hit, applies results immediately. If the attack kills or stuns the victim, the victim will not be able to act later in the round.

If the attacker has multiple attacks, he performs chooses a target and rolls to hit for each of his attacks.

## Hand-to-Hand Adjustments

Adjust your hand-to-hand attack roll as noted in the following checklist.

### Hand-to-Hand Weapon Adjustment to Hit and Damage Checklist

1. **Strength:** Str 3, -3; Str 4-5, -2; Str 6-8, -1; Str 13-15, +1; Str 16-17, +2; Str 18, +3
2. **Magic:** Adjustments according to spell or effect used
3. **Fighter Combat Options:** Smash: -5 to attack, add Strength score to damage; Lance Attack and Set Spear vs. Charge: Double damage.

### Hand-to-Hand Weapons Adjustments to Hit Only

1. **Weapon Mastery (Optional):** See the Attack Roll Bonuses Table under "Weapon Mastery" in Chapter 5.

When your character tries to attack a target in hand-to-hand or melee combat, adjust his attack and damage rolls for the following things:

**Strength:** Bonuses to hit and damage from exceptional Strength (or penalties, from exceptionally low Strength) apply to every hand-to-hand attack a player character makes.

**Magic:** A character may also benefit from magical spells or magical weapons. Some spells and enchanted weapons will give the character bonuses of +1, +2, or more to hit and to damage. Some weapons will only add bonuses against certain types of monsters, and the character doesn't get the bonuses from a weapon if he is not striking with that weapon, naturally.

**Maneuvers:** Three combat maneuvers can affect the attack roll and the amount of damage the character does with an attack. With the smash maneuver, the character takes a -5 penalty to hit, but adds his entire Strength score to the amount of damage he normally does with the attack. With the lance attack or set spear vs. charge maneuver, the PC rolls the amount of damage he does with the lance, doubles that amount, and then adds any other bonuses.

Optionally, adjust his attack roll if he is at a Skilled or better level of weapon mastery with the weapon he's using, as per the weapon mastery rules in Chapter 5.

## Two Weapons Combat (Optional)

In many fantasy and adventure novels and movies, characters can fight with two weapons, carrying one weapon in each hand. If the DM wants to simulate this in his campaign, he may—at his option—allow a character to attack with two weapons.

In this situation, a character who carries a weapon in each hand gets one additional attack per combat round. Both attacks take place during his hand-to-hand combat phase, one after the other. The attacker can decide each round which weapon he uses first and which he uses second. The second attack is at a penalty of -4 to hit (but not to damage).

## Weapon Mastery Penalties

If you are using the optional weapon mastery rules, there is an additional penalty: The second attack is treated as if at one mastery level lower than normal.

For instance, if a character has Expert mastery in both normal sword and short sword, and uses a normal sword for his first attack and short sword for his second, he strikes at Expert level with the normal sword but only at Skilled level with the short sword; also, his second attack does take the -4 attack roll penalty described earlier. If the character has only Basic mastery with his second weapon, it is treated as Basic mastery; it is not reduced to Unskilled. If a character is Unskilled with his second weapon, he may not use it for his second attack.

## Coordinating Multiple Attacks, Weapon Mastery, and Two Weapons Combat

**Multiple attacks** (the Fighter Combat Option) and the mystic's character class abilities both provide a character with extra attacks per round.

**Two weapons combat**, as described above, gives a character an extra attack when he has a weapon in each hand and decides to use both weapons in a combat round. One weapon from Chapter 4, the *cestus*, if used on the second hand, takes no off-hand penalty when used with these optional combat rules.

**With Weapon Mastery**, some weapons allow a character a second attack in a combat round with no off-hand penalty; one weapon, the tusked shield, can't be used with any other weapon, but allows two attacks, with neither attack at an off-hand penalty.

How do these rules work together?

### Multiple Attacks with Two Weapons Combat

If the campaign is using both multiple attacks and two weapons combat, the addition of two weapons combat allows a maximum of +1 attack per round, at the listed chances. For example, a 12th level fighter with two attacks per round carries a normal sword in one hand and a dagger in the other. With the two weapons combat rules, he gets +1 attack per round. Therefore, each round, he can attack twice with his normal sword (at no penalty) and once with his dagger (at a -4 attack roll penalty, and, if the

campaign uses weapon mastery rules, a -1 weapon mastery level reduction penalty).

### Multiple Attacks with Weapon Mastery

If the campaign is using both multiple attacks and weapon mastery (but not the two weapons combat rules), weapons that allow a second attack provide a maximum of +1 attack per round; such weapons do not strike at a penalty. As an example, a 24th level fighter has three attacks per round. Using a bastard sword (one-handed) as his main attack and a sword shield as his second weapon, he can attack three times (at no penalty) with his bastard sword and once (at no penalty) with his sword shield in one round.

### All Three Rules Together

If the campaign is using all three sets of rules (multiple attacks, two weapons combat, and weapon mastery), using both two weapons combat rules and weapon mastery weapons that add a second attack will provide a maximum of +1 attack per round.

If the off-hand weapon is a cestus or any one that, on its Weapon Mastery Table listing, says the weapon provides second attack (horned shield, knife shield, sword shield), the off-hand attack is at no penalty—neither an attack roll nor a weapon mastery level penalty. If the character is using a tusked shield, he gets his normal number of attacks per round, plus one attack for the tusked shield. If the off-hand weapon is any other type of weapon, it suffers the normal -4 attack roll penalty and -1 weapon mastery level penalty.

**Example:** A 24th level fighter has three attacks per round. His campaign uses the multiple attacks, weapon mastery, and two weapons combat rules. If he uses a normal one-handed weapon (with or without a shield) or a two-handed weapon, he gets three attacks per round, which is normal for his experience level and the multiple attacks rules.

If he uses a one-handed weapon in one hand and a cestus, horned shield, knife shield, or sword shield in the other, he gets four attacks per round—three with his primary weapon, one with his off-hand weapon. The off-hand attack does not take the -4 attack roll/-1 weapon mastery level penalty.

If he uses a one-handed weapon in one hand and another one-handed weapon in the other (but the second weapon is not a cestus, horned shield, knife shield, or sword shield), he has four attacks per round. Three are with his primary weapon, the fourth is with his off-hand weapon. The off-hand attack is at the -4 attack roll/-1 weapon mastery level penalty.

If he uses a tusked shield, he gets four attacks per round, all with the tusked shield; no attack suffers the -4 attack roll/-1 weapon mastery level penalty.

## Unarmed Combat

Unarmed combat occurs when a character attacks an opponent without using a weapon. In the standard rule for unarmed combat, an unarmed character inflicts 1 point of damage per hit plus any Strength bonuses. Strength penalties do not adjust unarmed combat damage to less than 1 point. Characters make normal attack

rolls and use all standard combat rules. Unarmed combat takes place in the hand-to-hand combat phase of the combat round.

All the following rules are options to expand unarmed combat, and can be used at the DM's discretion. The DM can also, if desired, give a 10% experience point bonus if player characters defeat monsters using unarmed combat.

## Striking and Wrestling (Optional)

### Who May Use Striking and Wrestling

All character classes and levels of characters may use striking and wrestling techniques.

In unarmed combat, the attacker either strikes an opponent (with a fist, kick, etc.), or tries to grab an opponent (jump on, tackle, etc.). Thus, we use two systems: One for striking, including all unarmed blows, and one for wrestling, for all other forms of unarmed combat.

Mystic-class characters only use the striking rules when they wish to fight someone without doing him significant harm; they already possess unarmed combat abilities that far surpass any abilities provided by the optional rules below.

### Unarmed Combat vs. Weapons of Opportunity

These striking and wrestling rules refer only to *unarmed combat*. If a character attacks another with a weapon, even a weapon of opportunity (mugs, tables, chairs, etc.), this is armed combat and follows normal combat rules. (Treat weapons of opportunity as clubs, generally with a -1 to -4 penalty to hit based on how clumsy the weapon is in the opinion of the DM.)

## Striking (Optional)

When one character hits his target in unarmed combat, this is called "striking." A strike normally results in either a "stun" or a "knockout." However, if the attacker has less than 4 Hit Dice, a stun is the only possible result. See the Striking Procedure Checklist for details.

### Restrictions

**Attacker Hit Dice:** Although any creature may attempt to strike an opponent, inexperienced (i.e., low level) characters do not do it very well. If the attacker has less than 4 Hit Dice, he cannot achieve a knockout result; a stun is the only possible result.

**Size Differences:** A strike cannot achieve a stun or knockout result if the victim is two or more times the size (height/length, not weight) of the attacker. (The strike will still do normal damage.) A halfing cannot do stun or knockout to a full-grown human, but can achieve these results against an elf or dwarf, which are not twice its height. When a character strikes a monster, the DM decides whether the victim is two or more times the size of the attacker.

**Monsters With Other Attacks:** Creatures whose weapons are parts of their bodies (such as claws) do not normally strike. There are exceptions: Bears, for example, can strike as well as claw. When a monster with natural hand-to-hand weapons also strikes, it does strike damage equal to half of its normal attack.

**Monster Immunities:** Creatures with multiple heads may suffer few or no results until *all* of its

heads have suffered stun or knockout results. Several types of creatures should be immune to some or all of the effects of Striking techniques. Use the following guidelines:

- Undead, constructs, and all oozes, jellies, and molds are completely immune to the effects of strikes—immune to damage, stun, and knockout results.
- If a creature can be hit only by magical weapons, striking has no effect *unless* the attacker is wearing a piece of magical apparel on the body part doing the striking. He would need a magical glove or gauntlet for fist strikes, magical boot for kicks, etc. Magical rings do *not count* as "apparel" for this purpose.
- Creatures that are immune to most normal weapons but do not necessarily require magic to hit them do not suffer damage from strikes, but can suffer stun or knockout results. (Example: Lycanthropes, which are immune to normal weapons but can be hit by silver weapons.) If the attacker is wearing magical apparel as described above, the strike attacks will also do damage to these types of monsters.

### Striking Procedure Checklist

1. During the hand-to-hand combat phase of the combat round, the player announces that he intends to strike. He may strike with his fist, foot (kick), head (butt), elbow, or knee. If he intends to use a fist, the character must be empty-handed, or may drop or put away an item in his striking hand.
2. The character goes through normal initiative and attack roll procedures.
3. If his strike hits, the character does the base damage of 0 plus any bonuses from a high Strength.
4. A victim hit by a strike must roll 1d20, and subtract his Constitution\* score from the result. If the total is 1 or more, the victim is stunned for one round. The stunned victim must also make a saving throw vs. death ray with a +4 bonus to the roll, or suffer a knockout. The duration of the knockout is simply the result of the "1d20-minus-Constitution-Score" roll in combat rounds.

\* If the victim is an NPC and his Constitution score is not known, the DM rolls or select one. If the victim is a monster, use twice its Hit Dice as its Constitution score (ignoring "pluses").

### Stun Effects

With the one-round stuns caused in unarmed combat, the victim cannot make any attacks until the stun wears off. (In some other types of stun, the stun might go on awhile, allowing the stunned character to attack, ineffectually, after a certain amount of time has passed.)

Also, while stunned, the victim moves at one-third the normal movement rate for whatever speed he is attempting. He suffers a -4 penalty to all his saving throws. He suffers a +4 penalty to his armor class (thus an AC 5 becomes a 9). He cannot concentrate, cast spells, or use magical

items. He cannot use general skills. Any weapon mastery skill he possesses above Basic level is reduced to Basic level.

### Knockout Effects

Knockout is simply a short sleep. The victim is unconscious and completely helpless.

### Striking and Combat Maneuvers

**Attack:** A strike is a normal use of the attack maneuver from the Combat Maneuvers Table earlier this chapter.

**Fighting Withdrawal:** An unarmed character can perform a fighting withdrawal normally.

**Retreat:** An unarmed character can perform a retreat maneuver normally, but not while he is striking.

### Striking and Two Weapons Combat

If the campaign is using the two weapons combat rules, then characters can strike with their off-hand instead of using weapons in that hand. The off-hand strike will suffer the normal penalties: -4 to hit, and (if you use the weapon mastery rules, too) -1 level of weapon mastery (Basic level stays Basic).

### Striking and Weapon Mastery (Optional)

The D&D® game world is a very physical and vigorous setting. Therefore, every character (regardless of character class) is presumed to have a Basic level of mastery with striking techniques. He does not have to spend a weapon mastery choice to get this; it is free.

Characters can train up to greater levels of mastery in striking, using the normal rules for weapon mastery. Instead of spending a new level of mastery on a weapon, the character would spend it on one type of unarmed combat. Systemized training in striking techniques is usually called boxing.

Look at "Weapon Mastery" in Chapter 5 for explanations of the symbols and abbreviations above. In short, they are:

- [P = H]: Primary target is hand-to-hand/thrown weapon-using monster.
- SM: Small "weapon."
- 1H: One-handed attack.
- SH: Shield may be used.
- t: Melee "weapon," rarely or never thrown.
- BS: Basic skill.
- SK: Skilled.
- EX: Expert.
- MS: Master.
- GM: Grand Master.

### Optional Rules for Striking

The DM may choose to use some, all, or none of the following optional rules for striking.

1. **Punching:** Only a fist strike can cause a knockout. All other strikes result in stuns at best, but for a duration of 1d20 minus the target's Constitution score in rounds.
2. **Tough Opponents:** A knockout is not possible if the victim has more Hit Dice than the attacker.
3. **Using Strength:** A character may decide not to use all of his or her Strength, "pulling the punch" so that no damage is inflicted. The character may either use his entire Strength bonus, or no Strength bonus, but may not choose a number in between.

|           | GM  | P:3d4; S:2d4+1 | —       | No off-hand penalty;<br>Stun, knockout (save -5) |

1. **Saving Throws:** If a character has a Strength adjustment, that adjustment also applies, in reverse, to the victim's saving throws vs. death ray to resist knockouts. For example, a Strength 17 fighter (+2 Strength bonus) strikes another character. If he achieves a stun result and the victim must save vs. death ray or be knocked out, the victim rolls his saving throw at a -2 penalty because of the attacker's great Strength. If a character has a low Strength and normally has a Strength penalty, that penalty becomes a bonus to the victim's saving throw.
2. **Objects in Hand:** A striking character may wear a cestus or carry a small, heavy object (such as a pouch full of coins). If he does so, his strike does normal strike damage (not weapon damage), but if the victim must save to avoid being knocked out, he takes a -2 penalty to his saving throw.
3. **Regenerating Victims:** If the victim has a power of regeneration (wearing a magical ring, for example), the duration of a knockout is reduced. Each point of regeneration ability reduces the knockout duration by 1 round every round. For example, a troll regenerates at 3 hit points per round. It suffers a knockout of 8 rounds duration. The first round it is knocked out, you count off one round of duration and subtract three more rounds for its regeneration. At the end of two rounds, the troll has used up its entire 8 round knockout duration.
4. **Fighter Combat Options:** The additional combat options for fighters and demihumans can be applied to all forms of striking.

**Multiple Attacks:** A character with multiple attacks who is able to hit his target with a roll of 2 can make multiple strikes. A character with multiple attacks who is using a weapon in one hand and nothing in the other, and who can hit his target with either type of attack with a roll of 2, can divide his attacks between weapon attacks and strikes.

**Smash:** An unarmed character with the smash maneuver option may smash with his fist; this is called a "haymaker." He suffers the normal -5 to hit, but the other smash rules are different for a haymaker. First, the unarmed character adds only *half* his Strength score to the damage he does with the smash. Second, a victim who must make a saving throw vs. death ray against knockout does so at a -4 penalty, negating the standard +4 bonus given. Third, the haymaker can affect monsters of *any size*; monsters two or more times the size of the attacker are not immune to stun and knockout effects of the haymaker.

**Parry:** Instead of attacking, the character

gains a -5 bonus to his armor class by blocking attacks with a weapon.

**Disarm:** An unarmed fighter can try to disarm an armed fighter.

## Wrestling (Optional)

When an unarmed character grabs a victim and tries to hold him, pin him, or bear him to the ground, this is called "wrestling." Humans, demihumans, humanoid monsters, and human-shaped undead monsters can all wrestle.

### Restrictions

**Who May Wrestle:** Any character of any class or level, most humanoid monsters, and undead monsters that were originally human, demi-human or humanoid may use wrestling.

**Initiative, Armed vs. Unarmed:** When a character attempts to wrestle an armed opponent, the armed opponent always wins initiative automatically.

**Unintelligent Monsters:** Unintelligent monsters will always choose to use their normal attacks instead of wrestling, unless controlled.

**Monster Immunities:** Several types of creatures are immune to some or all of the effects of wrestling: Noncorporeal undead (wraith, spectre, etc.), oozes, jellies, slimes, and similar creatures cannot be wrestled. Ethereal or elemental creatures can be wrestled only by opponents in the same form.

**Contact Abilities:** Special "touch" abilities (energy drain, turn to stone, etc.) function normally during wrestling if the monster wishes them to. For example, a character wrestling a cockatrice must make a saving throw vs. turn to stone every round while in contact with the monster.

### Preparing for Wrestling

#### **Wrestling Ratings (WR) Checklist**

##### **Characters and NPCs**

1. Divide the character's level by two, rounding up.
2. Add the bonuses (or subtract the penalties) for Strength and Dexterity scores.
3. Find the character's unmodified AC (not counting magic or Dexterity adjustments), and add the result to the total.

##### **Monsters**

1. Multiply the monster's Hit Dice by 2, not counting pluses.
2. If the monster is not wearing armor, add 9. If the monster *is* wearing armor (orc, kobold, giant, ogre, and other humansoids), add its armor class number instead of 9.

Before the game or a crucial battle, the DM should find each character's and monster's wrestling rating (WR).

**Characters and NPCs Example:** A 9th level dwarf has a Strength of 17 and a Dexterity of 8; he wears *chain mail* +3 and carries a shield. We take his experience level and divide by 2, rounding up (5), his Strength bonus (+2), his Dexterity penalty (-1), and his basic armor class, not counting magic or Dexterity adjustments (AC 4, for +4); adding these together, we get his wrestling rating (WR) of 10. If he'd drop his shield, his wrestling rating would go up to 11; if he'd take off his armor first, it would go up to 15.

**Monster Example:** A Snow Ape has 3 + 1 HD and wears no armor. We take its HD and multiply by 2, dropping pluses (6) and add 9 (+9); its WR is 15.

Worse armor classes (for instance, 9) result in better wrestling ratings than good armor classes (for instance, 2). This is correct. The more armor a character is wearing, the harder it is for him to wrestle effectively. Remember, magic bonuses and Dexterity adjustments do not count toward wrestling ratings.

Unlike other sections of the rules, in which Hit Dice and levels are equated, this section uses Hit Dice precisely, so a 25th level fighter still has only 9 Hit Dice.

### **Wrestling Procedure**

Each opponent involved in wrestling (whether attacking or defending) makes a simple roll of 1d20 each round. If the character is trying to wrestle, he adds his WR to the roll. If he is trying to do something else (such as strike, use a dagger, etc.), he does not add his WR that round. The highest roll wins the round. Ties dictate no result in that round. In normal wrestling contests, characters move up and down the following table according to how well they are doing.

Free  
Grab  
Takedown  
Pin

Before the wrestler wrestles his target, both targets are considered free. When one successfully attacks the other, he grabs his victim. If he wins the wrestling roll on the next round, he performs a takedown, bringing his opponent down to the ground and getting to a superior position over him. (If the victim is already down on the ground, the winner still gets into a superior position and sets himself up for the next round.) If he wins another wrestling roll on the next round, he has pinned his opponent.

This, of course, assumes that the victim isn't fighting back. The victim normally does fight back. So, each round the two parties are wrestling, each makes his wrestling roll. Compare the two 1d20 rolls. The higher roll wins. A tie means that there is no change in the characters' relative situations. Now, if one character wins one round, he moves the other fellow down one level (from grab to takedown, for example). If the other character wins the next, he moves the combat back up one level.

**Example:** Two characters are wrestling. The first fighter has a WR of 15, and the second has a

13. In the first round, the two come together and roll. The first fighter rolls a 9 on 1d20; that, plus his WR, equals 24. The second fighter rolls a 13; that, plus his WR, equals 26. The second fighter has grabbed the first.

Next round, the two roll again. The first fighter rolls a 15; that, plus his WR, equals 30. The second fighter, however, rolls a natural 20. That plus his WR equals 33. The second fighter takes his opponent down to the ground; he's winning this fight.

The third round, the first fighter rolls a 10 and the second fighter also rolls a 10; the first fighter's 25 wins over the second fighter's 23, and the first fighter breaks the takedown. Both fighters are now on the ground, and the first fighter is still grabbed, but he's no longer in imminent danger of being pinned.

On the fourth round, the first fighter rolls a 13 and the second fighter a 14. The first fighter's 28 has beaten the second fighter's 27, and the first fighter breaks out of the grab. Next round, the first fighter rolls a 9 and the second fighter a 3; the first fighter's 24 beats the second fighter's 16, and the first fighter grabs the second fighter.

In the sixth round, the first fighter rolls a 13 and the second fighter an 8; the first fighter wins again, and performs a takedown on the second fighter. In the seventh round, the first fighter rolls a 14 and the second fighter also rolls a 14; the first fighter's 29 beats the first fighter's 27, and the first fighter pins the second. He has won the match.

#### Wrestler vs. Attacker

One fighter could be wrestling while the other might be using some other attack, such as an unarmed strike or a dagger attack. In such a case, the character who is wrestling will be able to pin his opponent relatively quickly. However, the other character can still make attacks while grabbed or taken down, and might knock out the wrestler or stab him to death before the pin occurs.

#### Wrestling Effects

A character who is grabbed by a wrestler can still do many things. The easiest and most immediate reaction is to drop everything and counter-grapple the wrestling attack. He can also throw a small or medium throwing weapon (not at the person who has grabbed him!) and attack unarmed or with any small or medium hand weapon. If he has the Fighter Combat Options, he can smash, can perform a disarm, and can use multiple attacks with any of the attacks still available to him. He cannot fire a missile weapon, cast a spell, use a magical item, perform a fighting withdrawal, retreat, lance attack, set spear vs. charge, or party.

A character who has been taken down has fewer options. He can throw only small throwing weapons (still not at the person who has taken him down) and attack unarmed or with any small hand weapon. Counter-grappling against the wrestler is still available while taken down. If he has the Fighter Combat Options, he can use multiple attacks with any of the attacks still available to him. He cannot fire a missile weapon, cast a spell, use a magical item, perform a fighting withdrawal, retreat, lance attack, set spear vs. charge, smash, parry, or disarm.

#### Wrestling Unarmed Combat Mastery Table

| Technique | Lvl | Damage       | Defense | Special Effects                           |
|-----------|-----|--------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| Wrestling | BS  | 1 point      | —       | Grab, takedown, pin<br>(-3 to pinned WR)  |
| [P = H]SM | SK  | 1d3          | +1 WR   | Grab, takedown, pin<br>(-6 to pinned WR)  |
| 2Ht       | EX  | 1d4+1        | +2 WR   | Grab, takedown, pin<br>(-9 to pinned WR)  |
|           | MS  | P:2d4; S:1d4 | +3 WR   | Grab, takedown, pin<br>(-12 to pinned WR) |
|           | GM  | P:3d4; S:2d4 | +4WR    | Grab, takedown, pin<br>(-15 to pinned WR) |

A pinned character can perform no combat maneuvers. Once per round, however, he can make his wrestling roll (at a -3 penalty) to try to escape the pin. If he ever beats his opponent's wrestling roll, he breaks the pin and returns to being taken down.

The pinning character can inflict 1-6 points of damage (plus Strength bonus, if any), if he wishes to; he does not have to inflict this damage. If he plans to do damage to his pinned opponent, he must state his intent during the hand-to-hand combat phase of the round. The victim can make a saving throw vs. death ray to avoid all damage, and a natural "20" is an escape from a pin. If a group has pinned a character (see below), all of them can inflict damage, but the defender only makes one saving throw.

#### Multiple Wrestlers

When three or more characters all decide to wrestle against a common opponent, find the single wrestler with the highest WR (called the "leader"). Use his wrestling roll for the entire group, modified as follows:

1. For each group member with half (or less) the leader's Hit Dice, add 1 to the group WR.
2. For each group member with more than half the leader's Hit Dice, add 5 to the group WR.

A maximum of four attackers can wrestle an opponent of equal size. Up to eight attackers can wrestle an opponent of twice their size, 12 against an opponent of triple their size, etc.

#### Wrestlers Being Attacked

When a wrestler has grabbed, taken down, or pinned a victim and is then attacked by another wrestler, the defending wrestler may either (a) release his victim and defend normally, or (b) continue to hold his victim and try to defend against the new attack with a -4 penalty to his WR. While holding a grabbed, taken down, or pinned victim, he can make no other grabs. Each roll he wins merely indicates he successfully avoids the new attack, while holding the previously-grabbed victim.

When a wrestler has grabbed, taken down, or pinned a victim and is then attacked by a non-wrestler, the defending wrestler may either (a) release his victim and defend normally, or (b) continue to hold his victim. If he releases his victim, he gets his full armor class and can attack by other means than wrestling. But if he continues to hold his victim, he's very easy to hit; treat him as being AC 9, with no Dexterity bonuses, and he cannot attack the new attacker.

#### Wrestling and Combat Maneuvers

See "Wrestling Effects" for guidelines on which normal combat maneuvers may be used against a wrestler.

*Fighting Withdrawal, Retreat:* A character who has been grabbed, taken down, or pinned cannot perform these maneuvers.

*Multiple Attacks:* A character who has multiple attacks still makes only one wrestling roll per combat round. If he does not wrestle, he may use his usual number of attacks per round.

#### Wrestling and Weapon Mastery

As with striking earlier, every character is presumed to have a Basic level of mastery with wrestling techniques. This does not cost the character a weapon mastery choice; it is free. As with striking, characters can train up to greater levels of weapon mastery in wrestling, using the normal rules for weapon mastery. Instead of spending a new level of mastery on a weapon, the character would spend it on wrestling.

Look at the "Weapon Mastery" rules in Chapter 5 for explanations of the symbols and abbreviations on the Wrestling Unarmed Combat Mastery table. In short, they are:

- [P = H]: Primary target is hand-to-hand/ thrown weapon-using monster.
- SM: Small "weapon."
- 2H: Two-handed attack.
- t: Melee "weapon," rarely or never thrown.
- BS: Basic skill.
- SK: Skilled.
- EX: Expert.
- MS: Master.
- GM: Grand Master.

As you can see, a wrestling "weapon master" pins his victims more and more effectively; he does more damage each round, and the victim has a harder time (reflected in the minus to his wrestling rating) to get free of the pin.

#### Optional Rules for Wrestling

The DM may choose to use some, all, or none of the following optional rules for wrestling.

1. **Instant Pin:** When one wrestler's wrestling roll (1d20 + WR), is 20 or more points higher than the other's, the loser is instantly pinned, regardless of what the two wrestlers' relative positions were previously.
2. **Class Adjustments:** When calculating a character's wrestling rating, adjust the wrestling rating according to character class: -1 penalty to magic-users; +1 bonus to fighter, dwarf, thief, and mystic; no adjustment for other classes.

## Chapter 8: Combat

![Illustration of a knight on a winged horse attacking a large dragon with a lance, while the dragon breathes fire.]()![](_page_113_Picture_1.jpeg)

1. Opponents with Multiple Attacks: If a creature has multiple attacks and is pinned, only one attack is negated by each pin. For example, two attackers pinning a troll would negate its bite and one claw, but the troll would still be able to use its second claw attack each round.
2. Simplified Rolls: When comparing die rolls ( $1d20 + WR$ ), subtract the lower wrestling rating from the higher. The opponent with the higher rating adds the difference to his  $1d20$  roll, and the other opponent rolls  $1d20$  unmodified. For example, a fighter with a WR of 12 is wrestling a bugbear with a WR of 15; subtracting the 12 from 15 gives the bugbear a +3 bonus to wrestling rolls against normal  $1d20$  wrestling rolls for the fighter.
3. General Skills: In the "General Skills" section of Chapter 5, you will find a Wrestling skill that adds to a character's wrestling rating.

### Aerial Combat

In aerial combat, most normal forms of attacks are rendered useless and characters must usually rely on missile fire and magic to carry the battle to their foes. As in land battles and higher ground, the creature highest in the air usually has an advantage. (The DM may want to record the altitude of each creature.) Speed is also very important. DMs can place bonuses and penalties on attacks based on the altitude and speed differences of opponents.

### Combat Effects of Flying

#### Hand-to-Hand Combat

A character's mount or means of flight determines the sort of melee weapons he can use effectively. If a character is using a *fly* spell, he can use melee weapons effectively. He can, for example, fly right up to a winged mount and attack it or its rider, easily avoiding its flapping wings.

If a character's mount has magical flight instead of wings (for example, a *flying carpet* or a *djinj*), the character can use medium or large weapons effectively. Difficulty in maneuvering and weapons' lack of reach make it impossible for him to use small weapons.

If a character is riding a mount that flies by use of wings, he must use only large weapons. Most riders of winged beasts prefer the lance, which works just as well in the air as it does on the ground.

In combat, follow the combat sequence normally. Hand-to-hand attacks do not suffer any special penalties when made in aerial combat. If a flier passes within range of another flier during his movement phase, even if he does not finish his movement within weapon range, he can make a hand-to-hand attack on his target. However, his target can make a return attack on the target's own hand-to-hand phase, even if the two flyers are no longer close to one another. Both attacks occur when the two flyers are in range, and then the flying mounts complete their movement for the round.

#### Monster Combat

Flying monsters may also attack in aerial com-

bat. They attack with their attack roll chances and damage rolls whenever they come within range of an enemy. Well-trained monsters will only attack targets designated by their riders.

#### Missile Combat

Conduct missile fire normally during aerial combat. Some flying mounts are unsteady, though, and missile firers suffer attack roll penalties when firing from them. The *fly* spell and flying magical items (carpets, brooms, ships, etc.) are considered steady platforms. Attackers using missile weapons suffer no special attack roll penalties when firing from such platforms. Other means of flight, such as a pegasus which flies by flapping its wings, are considered unsteady. Firing a missile or throwing a weapon from such a platform has a -4 penalty to hit.

#### Spellcasting

Spellcasting requires a steady platform, while many magical devices do not require a steady hand.

### Special Aerial Attacks

#### Bombing

Robots and other items can be dropped from an altitude of 300' or less, using an attack roll of 16 or better (regardless of the target's normal armor class). The damage depends on the size of the flyer. For example, if a flying mount can carry a man, the flyer may instead carry an equivalent amount of encumbrance in rocks to inflict 2-12 points of damage to all within a 10' X 10' area (one attack roll per victim).

### Swoop Attack

Certain flying creatures may also make a "swoop" attack on any opponent at a lower altitude. This attack is similar to a Charge, but applies to flying creatures rushing over 10 feet toward their prey. This attack, if successful, inflicts double damage upon its target, but only if the attacking creature surpasses its target.

If the attack roll is 18 or more and the monster has talons or some way to hold prey, the monster grasps the victim and attempts to fly away with its victim. If the victim is too heavy, the monster lets go immediately. A swoop cannot be used in dense forest or jungle cover.

**Example:** A roc of 3 Hit Dice can lift a halfing easily, while a 6 Hit Die roc can carry away a man. Horses can be carried away by 12 Hit Dice rocs, and a 24 Hit Die roc can lift an elephant or creature of similar encumbrence.

The DM can add freely to the existing guidelines for aerial combat as needed. DMs are free to develop their own rules for climbing and diving, turning, crashing, and other aerial maneuvers pertaining to both travel and combat. Other factors to consider include weather conditions while in flight, skills in riding aerial mounts, and the problems of falling riders.

## Naval Combat

Naval combat between water vessels usually starts with missile fire and magic. When the boats are close enough, the enemy craft is grappled and boarded, and hand-to-hand combat takes place between the two crews. A ship with a ram can do special damage to other ships and large monsters.

Read the rules for "Evasion at Sea" in Chapter 7. They describe how vessels close upon one another. Combat at sea is fought in rounds.

It is helpful to have a sketch of the ships' deck plans during boarding actions.

Unless noted otherwise, giant sea creatures and magic attacks inflict 1 point of hull damage for every 5 points of normal damage.

### Missile Combat

Crews of ships can fire upon one another whenever they come within missile range. Ships armed with catapults will tend to be more effective than those without. Hand missile weapons such as bows and crossbows can damage and kill crewmen but do no effective damage against the ship itself. A catapult, on the other hand, does its full damage to either ship or living target. You'll find rules for catapults in Chapter 4.

### Close-Quarters Combat

When ships come close to one another, they normally try to ram or board one another.

#### Ramming

To ram a target, the ship must bring its bow into contact with the enemy ship—in other words, it must close until it touches the enemy ship. Ships can also ram large sea-monsters. Small targets are impossible to hit with a ship. They can easily outmaneuver a ramming vessel.

The ram attack takes place in the missile phase of the combat round in which the ships touch.

The ramming ship's pilot rolls to hit as if he were a 1st level fighter attacking the target ship's armor class. The DM can modify this for weather conditions, maneuverability, and other factors. The ram, if it hits, does damage to the ship's hull points (or, if it hits a large sea creature, to the creature's hit points).

Each successful ram attack does damage according to the size of the ramming vessel as shown in the Ram Attacks Table.

#### Ram Attacks Table

| Ramming Vessel   | Opponent | Damage               |
|------------------|----------|----------------------|
| Small galley     | Ship     | 1d4+1x10<br>(50-80)  |
|                  | Creature | 3d8 (3-24)           |
| Large/war galley | Ship     | 1d6+5X10<br>(60-110) |
|                  | Creature | 6d6 (6-36)           |

On the same round the attacker has rammed the defender, it may decide to grapple during the hand-to-hand phase of the combat round. If its crew does successfully grapple, they can begin to board on the next combat round's movement phase.

#### Damage to Ships

Each 10% of hull damage reduces the ship's speed by 10%, until the ship is repaired in port. Each 10% loss of rowers reduces a ship's rowed speed by 10% also. When the ship has suffered 75% of its hull points in damage, the ship is dead in the water; it cannot move until at least makeshift repairs are made. When the ship has taken all its hull points in damage, it sinks, and repairs are no longer possible.

#### Grappling and Boarding

Ships' crews attempt to grapple at a distance of 50' or less. If both ships' crews want to grapple, grappling is automatically successful. Both crews throw out grappling lines, both sets of lines connect, and the ships are drawn together. If only one ship's crew wants to grapple, roll 1d6 every round; a result of 1-2 indicates success while a 3-6 means that the other crew successfully cuts and casts the grappling lines free.

After ships are grappled, the boarding battle is fought just like any large hand-to-hand combat. Characters boarding an enemy vessel have a penalty of +2 on armor class and -2 on all attack rolls during the combat round they board; the difficulty of climbing over two sets of ship's rails and finding footing on an enemy's deck puts them at risk. The battle continues until the crew of one ship surrenders or dies.

#### Repairs

A ship's crew may repair up to half the damage the ship has taken. Five or more crewmen must be assigned to repair duty for repairs to be effective. A repair crew can repair one point of hull damage per full turn of work. These repairs are makeshift and will fall apart in 6d6 days; for permanent repairs, and to get the remaining hull points repaired, the crew must get the ship to a port.

Repairs and attempts to put out fires (see "Siege Combat") take place *after* the ship sus-

tains its damage for the turn. Repair and fire crews cannot fight or do anything else while performing these tasks.

## Underwater Combat

The following guidelines are in effect when characters perform combat while underwater:

**Basic Penalty:** All surface dwellers suffer a -4 to attack rolls (for ranged and hand-to-hand combat) underwater. The DM is free to diminish that penalty as the characters become accustomed to underwater fighting; as a rule of thumb, characters make an Intelligence check for each month spent underwater, and success eliminates one -1 penalty until the penalty is gone.

**Missile Weapons:** Most missile weapons do not work underwater. Only crossbows made by *undersea dwellers* (such as mermen) will function. Even with those crossbows, read all underwater ranges in feet at all times.

**Spells:** Spells that are associated with the elemental plane of Air or Fire do not work underwater. Characters cannot cast spells at all unless they have already cast a *water-breathing* or *create air* spell or are using a magical item that allows them to breathe.

**Hand-to-Hand Weapons:** Cutting, slashing, and smashing weapons (axes, swords, maces, etc.) are not useful underwater. They suffer a -10 penalty to hit and do only half damage. Thrusting and piercing weapons (spears, tridents, daggers, short swords, lances, etc.) function normally.

## Siege Combat

There are three ways to conduct siege combat: 1. Play a normal game session based on the siege.

2. Use the Siege Machine rules.

3. Use expanded War Machine rules.

Mass combat rules are in the next chapter. This chapter only covers sieges conducted under the normal rules. The action centers on an assault, in which the attackers storm the walls of a fortification using spells, ladders, rams, and siege equipment. Defensive walls may be battered down or breached before the assault takes place.

## Structural Damage

The damage ranges listed for creatures, normal weapons, siege weapons, and spells are for attacks against characters and creatures. Siege weapons and buildings, however, are more resistant to damage. Statistics and other information for siege weapons and fortifications are given in Chapters 4 and 9.

### Fortification Damage

There are four types of attacks that can be done to a building, as follows.

- **Creature:** Damage done by character unarmed combat, by melee weapons, missile weapons, and thrown weapons (normal or magical), and by many creature attacks (claws, fangs).
- **Structural:** Damage done by siege weapons, rams, battering attacks by creatures of ogre size or larger, damage caused by creatures that can eat wood or burrow through stone.

![Decorative header image]()![](_page_115_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 8: Combat

![Decorative header image]()![](_page_115_Picture_2.jpeg)

- **Fire:** Damage caused by ignition—by fire that has caught (not by fire-related spells).
- **Special:** Damage caused by spells or special creature attacks.

There are also three types of targets, as follows.

- **Monsters:** This includes all characters and all living and undead monsters.
- **Wooden:** All wooden structures, including siege equipment, wooden sailing vessels, wagons, huts, wooden houses, and wooden parts of stone constructions.
- **Stone:** All stone structures, including walls, buildings, natural cover such as stony bluffs and hills, and other stone constructions (but not including stone golems, living statues, etc.).

## Special Attacks

Special attacks include natural creature abilities, spells, and magical effects. Special attacks that cause physical damage are outlined in the Special Attacks Checklist.

### Special Attacks Checklist

#### Against wooden structures:

Normally cause half damage.

If attack is a spell and no damage range is given (as with *disintegrate*), it causes 5 points per level of the spell.

#### Against stone constructions:

Causes 1 point per six-sided die of damage.

If attack doesn't use d6, attack causes 1 point per 5 points of maximum possible damage, rounded up.

If attack is a spell and no damage range is given, it causes 2 points per level of the spell.

Special types of damage from other special attacks are as follows.

**Acid:** This attack causes full damage to wood but only the normal structural damage to stone.

**Blackball:** Treat this monster as if a *disintegrate* spell.

**Constructs:** These monsters cause damage at the normal reductions, but do not take any damage when attacking stone structures.

**Creeping Doom:** See Insect Plague.

**Crystallize:** This attack weakens both wood and stone structures. All subsequent physical attacks at the weakened point cause twice the normal structural damage, up to a total of 50 points, when the effect ceases.

**Dissolve:** This spell only works against un-crafted stone and will not affect a castle wall. If cast on the bedrock beneath a wall, there is a 10% chance per spell that a 10-foot wide section of the wall will collapse.

**Elemental, Air:** This category includes djinni, aerial servants, and invisible stalkers. Attacks from these creatures cause normal structural damage but have no effect on stone.

**Elemental, Earth:** This category includes kryst and horde creatures. Attacks against wood cause normal structural damage but attacks against stone cause twice the normal structural damage.

**Elemental, Fire:** This category includes effrei and helions. Attacks cause normal structural damage as fire, but the fire cannot be extinguished as long as the creature remains within

30 feet of the fire.

**Elemental, Water:** This category includes hydrax and undines. Attacks against wood cause normal structural damage but attacks against stone cause only 1 point for every 10 points of damage inflicted, rounded up.

**Falling:** Wooden and stone structures take half normal falling damage.

**Fire:** Wooden structures can be damaged by fire, but take only 1 point per 6-sided die of damage or per 5 points of maximum possible damage, rounded up.

Furthermore, wooden items attacked by fire can be set afire, causing further damage. The chance of being set afire is 5% per point of damage caused by each fire attack. Anything set afire will take 1 point of damage the first round, 3 more points by the end of the first turn, 6 points the second turn and 12 points for each turn thereafter, until destroyed.

Any creature caught within a burning structure will take damage equal to 1d6 per point of structural damage at the same rate. Any flammable structures next to a structure that has been set afire may also catch fire with a chance of +10% for each turn the first structure burns.

If water or loose earth and workers are available, the workers may attempt to extinguish the fire. Each turn a fire is fought, the player should roll 1d6 per 10 workers. This is the number of points of structural fire damage extinguished that turn. If the number is greater than the fire damage for that turn, the fire is extinguished. Only 10 people may fight a fire for every 30 feet of structure frontage. Each fire fighter suffers 1 point of damage per point of structural damage caused that turn. If the fire was caused by special catapult shot or a dragon, fire fighters can extinguish only half the normal number of points.

Stone will not burn, but wooden parts of stone constructions will burn (roofs, floors, doors, etc.). Fire damage is the same as for wooden structures, but only 10% of the total hit points of a stone building may be burned.

**Flood:** A flood is a forceful wave of water that crashes against a structure. Damage is subject to the normal structural reductions for physical damage. Damage is equal to 3-24 points per 10 foot height of the wave or depth of the mouth of a broken dam. If the flood is from a lake, it will last for 1 round per 100 square yards of surface area of the lake.

**Ice:** An ice attack works the same as *crystallize* but lasts for only 1-6 rounds.

**Insect Plague:** This attack causes full damage to wooden structures but no damage to stone constructions.

**Lava:** Lava works like fire when attacking both wood and stone but causes twice the amount of damage as fire. Lava causes 1d6 points of damage per square yard.

**Lightning:** This is treated as a physical attack against wood and stone, with a 5% chance to catch fire per each 2 points of damage.

**Magical Weapons:** When a magical weapon is used, the magical bonuses should be added only after making the noted reductions for physical structures.

**Passwall:** This spell has no effect against wood but will cause a breach in a stone structure.

**Poison Gas:** No effect.

**Polymorph Object:** There is a 10% chance

that the spell will have no effect when cast on a wood or stone structure. *Polymorphing* may create a breach in a stone or wooden wall.

**Reverse Gravity:** Anything lifted by this spell suffers falling damage as if dropped from 20 feet. However, anything fastened or rooted to the ground is not affected.

**Shrink:** The nightcrawler may shrink something up to 50,000 cm actual weight. There is a 10% chance that the ability will have no effect on wood or stone structures. If affected, the structure shrinks to one-sixth size and functions at one-sixth effect.

**Turn wood:** This spell causes no damage but moves wooden objects to the extent of its range unless they are fastened down.

**Warp wood:** This has no effect on wooden siege equipment.

**Web:** If used on a siege weapon, this spell renders it useless for the duration of the spell.

**Wizard Lock:** This spell makes a siege weapon unusable for the duration of the spell.

## Important Note About Special Attacks

Equipment and structures *do not get* a saving throw against special attacks.

## Special Defenses

Some spells may be cast on wooden and stone structures in order to improve their defense. This is normally done to close up a breach that siege equipment has made in a wall. Normal effects apply in all cases. Magical walls and spells like *web* and *growth ofplants* can close up a breach in question for the spell duration or until the barrier they create is also breached.

## NPC Siege Specialists

The following NPCs are necessary for any operation involving siege equipment:

- **Artillerist (250 gp/level/month):** An artillerist is an NPC trained and experienced in the operation of siege artillery (catapult or trebuchet). One artillerist is needed for each piece of siege artillery.
- **Siege Engineer (1,000 gp/month):** A siege engineer designs siege equipment and assists the commander in their tactical use. A siege engineer must be employed if any special siege equipment (not including ladder or timber fort) is used. One siege engineer is needed for each five pieces of large equipment used. Large equipment includes all mantlets, belfries and hoists, but not artillery.
- Engineers may supervise troops used as miners. One engineer is needed per excavation. In one day, one miner can dig out 20 cubic feet of hard rock, 40 cubic feet of soft rock, or 60 cubic feet of hard-packed earth. Up to ten miners can work in one excavation.

## General Skills

If you are using the optional general skills, then one skill, labelled *Artillery*, suffices for both artillerists and siege engineers; however, characters can learn the skill either as an artillerist or as a siege engineer. To learn how to both operate the weapons and how they are built and used most effectively, a PC must choose this skill twice.

There are times in a D&D® game session when it's necessary to play out large-scale battles in the form of a wargame. This happens most often when the player characters are very experienced and are in command of an army. At that point, it's often not enough just to role-play out the battle's results; the players want to be personally responsible for the implementation of the plans, the carrying out of their orders, and the success or failure of their troops. This chapter allows players to oversee and command large scale battles.

This chapter is divided into two sections:

Part One, "The War Machine," shows you how to conduct land engagements such as the conflicts between armies.

Part Two, "The Siege Machine," expands the War Machine rules to include assaults on fortifications such as castles.

## The War Machine

The War Machine is a system of game rules designed to resolve large battles in the D&D game. The War Machine will work with any number of troops; it is recommended for any force with more than ten combatants. To use the system, all you need is a pencil and paper, plus some knowledge of simple arithmetic.

## Assumptions

Several assumptions are made in the War Machine mass combat system:

1. All troops have a "level of quality" that can improve or drop with time and experience.
2. Many other factors such as terrain, weather, etc., besides quality of troops, influence the outcome of a large battle.
3. Luck, good or bad, can influence combat results, whether in a single combat or a clash of armies.
4. A character knows how to survive in the D&D world; the *player* does not need to know the tactics of war.

## How It Works

Each body of troops (called a "force") is given a rating for quality. When combat occurs, this "battle rating" (sometimes abbreviated as BR) is modified for battle conditions (terrain, number of opponents, morale, etc.). Each player then rolls d%, and adds the modified battle rating of the troops. The high roll wins the battle.

The entire system has four basic steps:

1. Calculate the *basic force rating (BFR)* of the troops.
2. Find the *troop class*.
3. Calculate the *battle rating (BR)*.
4. Determine and apply *combat results*.

Steps 1, 2, and 3 are handled when a force is hired and outfitted. Step 4 is used when a battle occurs. Throughout the system, the person or creature commanding a force is called the *leader*. Others, called *officers*, help the leader to control the force. The fighting persons in a force are called *troops*.

In the calculations, round all fractions *up* unless the instructions say otherwise.

### Step 1: Calculate the *basic force rating*

The basic force rating is the total of four factors: leadership, experience, training, and equipment. A fifth factor applies if the force is special: elves, dwarves, or powerful monsters.

**Leadership Factor:** Find the experience level of the leader of the force. Modify it by all the leader's adjustments for Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Then add a +2 bonus for each 1% of the force that is of Name level (9th level or above) characters (PCs or NPCs).

$$\begin{array}{l} \text{Leader's experience level} \\ + \text{Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma adjustments} \\ + 2 \text{ per } 1\% \text{ of force that is Name level} \\ = \text{Leadership Factor} \end{array}$$

**Experience Factor:** Find the average experience level of the officers in the force (not counting the leader), and multiply it by 3. For nonhuman troops, the officer level is the average Hit Dice, plus one. Note: A force must have at least one officer for every 40 troops, or this part of the experience factor is zero.

Find the average level of the troops (not including the leader or officers), double it, and add that to the officer rating. Add 1 to the total for every victory the force has won in the last ten years (+10 maximum), and subtract 1 for every time the force has been routed in that time (-10 maximum).

$$\begin{array}{l} \text{([Total levels of officers] / [Number of officers])} \times 3 \\ + \text{([Total level of troops] / [Number of troops])} \times 2 \\ + 1 \text{ per victory (up to +10)} \\ - 1 \text{ per rout (upto -10)} \\ = \text{Experience Factor} \end{array}$$

**Training Factor:** Score 1 point for every week spent in training (maximum 20 per year). Add 1 for each week that the leader spends with them (maximum 20), and add 1 for each month that the troops remain together and are not off in their homes or towns (maximum 12 per year).

**Costs:** Use the "Mercenary" pay rates from Chapter 11. Training time costs double the standard amounts shown in that chapter.

$$\begin{array}{l} + 1 \text{ per week trained (up to 20)} \\ + 1 \text{ per week leader trained with them (up to 20)} \\ + 1 \text{ per month troops on duty (up to 12)} \\ = \text{Training Factor} \end{array}$$

**Equipment Factor:** The base value is 5, 10, or 15, depending on the quality of the weapons. Use 5 if the weapons are "average" (the normal cost). All troops are assumed to have average weapons unless others are specified. Use 10 if the weapons are "good" (double normal cost), or 15 if "excellent" (triple normal cost).

Add 5 if the troops are armed with a second weapon of the same quality as the first. Add 5 more points if the average armor class of the troops is 5 or better.

**Costs:** Troops hired at the cost for mercenaries

come with their own gear, and that gear will be of average quality. If the leader of the force wants to buy them superior weapons or armor, the cost comes out of his own pocket.

$$+ 5, 10, \text{ or } 15 \text{ (based on quality of weapon)}$$

$$+ 5 \text{ (if carry a second weapon of equal quality)}$$

$$+ 5 \text{ (if } \text{AC} = 5 \text{ or better)}$$

-EquipmentFactor

**Special Troop Factor:** If the troops are all either elves or dwarves, this factor is 15. Note that dwarves and elves are never in the same force.

If some monster troops have two or more asterisks listed with their Hit Dice, they are "Special." For each 1% of the force that is "Special," score 2 points for this factor. For example, in a force of 290 ghouls and 10 spectres, 4% of the force (the spectres) has two asterisks, for a special factor of +8.

**Add It All Up: Basic Force Rating (BFR)**

Add all these factors to find the basic force rating (BFR) of the force. Record this number for future reference.

$$\begin{array}{l} \text{Leadership} \\ + \text{Experience} \\ + \text{Training} \\ + \text{Equipment} \\ + \text{Special Troop} \\ = \text{Basic Force Factor} \end{array}$$

### Step 2: Find the *troop class*

Troop class is a measure of the overall quality of a force. Once you know the BFR of the force, use the table below to find the troop class. Keep a record of both the BFR and the troop class.

#### Troop Class Table

| BFR   | Troop Class   | BFR     | Troop Class |
|-------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| 0-20  | Untrained     | 71-80   | Average     |
| 21-35 | Poor          | 81-100  | Good        |
| 36-55 | Below Average | 101-125 | Excellent   |
| 56-70 | Fair          | 126+    | Elite       |

### Step 3: Calculate the *battle rating (BR)*

Divide the BFR of the force by 10, rounding up. The result is the bonus to use in all the following calculations.

Examine the following statements and their explanations, and then add the bonus to the BFR *every time one of the statements is true*. (For example, if statement "a" is true and statement "b" is true, you add the bonus twice.) Since this could be done up to 12 times, the total bonus could be more than the original BFR.

The total BR is the original BFR plus all bonuses. Note the BR with the troop class and the BFR.

#### Mounted:

1. 20% or more of the force is mounted.
2. 50% or more of the force is mounted.

## Missiles:

c. 20% or more of the force can use missile fire.  
d. 20% or more of the force has a missile fire range of 100' or more.

## Magical:

e. 1% or more of the force is equipped with magical abilities.  
f. 20% or more of the force is equipped with magical abilities.  
g. 100% of the force is equipped with magical abilities.

## Spells:

h. 5% or more of the force can cast spells.  
i. 30% or more of the force can cast spells.

## Flying:

j. 1% or more of the force can fly.  
k. 20% or more of the force can fly.

## Speed:

l. The force has an average movement rate of 100' per turn (or more).

## Explanations

*Mounted* applies to any "steed," including horses, dire wolves, griffons, dragons, etc.

*Missiles* includes bows, crossbows, slings, and others (giant-thrown boulders, manticores spikes, etc.).

*Magical* includes magical weapons (*sword* +1, *arrow* +2, et al.), breath weapons, any poison, magical defenses, regeneration, energy drain, wands and other devices, etc.

*Spells* includes only spells memorized, cast from scrolls, or spell-like natural abilities (such as a spirit's).

*Flying* includes normal and magical forms,

but nor mere levitation. It applies to flying steeds as well (such as pegasi).

*Speed* should be calculated with a creature's fastest mode of movement. For example, flying creatures should be used at their flying rate, not their walking rate.

*Example:* An elven prince has a force of 500 elves, all 2nd level and equipped with bows and longswords. The BFR is 96, and troop class is "Good." One hundred of his elves are mounted on pegasi, and all the elves can cast spells. However, only 12 elves have magical items.

The bonus is 10% of 96: 9.6, which rounds up to 10. The prince adds 10 to the BFR eight times: for a. (20% are mounted), c. and d. (more than 20% can fire missiles, and the maximum range is greater than 100'), h. and i. (the entire force can cast spells), j. and k. (20% of the force can fly), and l. (the average movement rate is well over 100' per turn).

The total bonus of +80, added to the BFR, gives a total BR of 176.

## Quick Battle Ratings

Situations will often arise where players and DMs don't want to take the time to use the full system for determining battle ratings. The following quick system will work for most troops, without requiring as many calculations. If there is an extremely powerful force (because of level, abilities, Hit Dice, etc.), it is probably better to use the full process; this process works better for lower level and simpler units.

a. Start with the leader's level: + \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
b. Add ONE of these, based on the average Hit Dice of the force:

Less than 1: 20  
1 to 2 + : 30  
3 to 4 + : 40  
5 to 6 + : 55  
7 to 8 + : 65  
9 or more: 80

## Hit Dice Factor:

+ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c. Add if the force has any:

archers: +10 + \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
spellcasters: +10 + \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
magical beings: +10 + \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
flying beings: +10 + \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

d. Add the maximum damage per round of the most numerous creature type:

+ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Quick Total BR: = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Dividing a Force

For you to use the War Machine in a battle, each side must have the same number of forces or armies. If one side has a greater number of forces than the other side, the side with fewer forces must be divided into an equal number of armies. A player may keep the original rating of the force, and simply declare that troops have been split into separate armies.

*Example:* A force of 1,000 orcs (BR 72) meets three other forces: 200 elves (BR 83), 400 men (BR 70), and 140 dwarves (BR 88). The orcs must split into three forces, all of which will have the same BR (72). These might be 100, 100 and 800,

![Illustration of a large, rugged mountain landscape with a river flowing through it. In the foreground, there are several small structures and a few figures standing on a rocky outcrop on the right. The scene depicts a setting for a battle.]()![](_page_117_Picture_35.jpeg)

or any other combination, as long as at least 10 individuals are in each force.

Each force picks its opponent; the player with the force having the highest BR chooses first, then the force with the next-highest BR, and so on. Continuing the example above, the dwarves pick one group of 100 orcs. The next highest rated force picks an opponent; the elves take the other group of 100 orcs. The third highest rating is the orcs, so they would choose next—but there is only one remaining force, the men, so the 800 orcs will fight the 400 men.

## Step 4: Determine combat results

The forces that have been rated according to the above three steps are now prepared to meet on the field of battle. To find out what the result of this engagement is, start with the BR of each force, and add or subtract all of the following adjustments that apply.

### 1. Troop Ratio (Use only one per battle):

- + 15 if 1.5 to 1
- + 30 if 2 to 1
- + 45 if 3 to 1
- + 60 if 4 to 1
- + 70 if 5 to 1
- + 80 if 6 to 1
- + 90 if 7 to 1
- + 100 if 8-10 to 1
- + 110 if 11-15 to 1
- + 120 if 16-20 to 1
- + 130 if 21-30 to 1
- + 140 if 31-40 to 1
- + 150 if 41-50 to 1
- + 160 if 51-60 to 1, etc.

### 2. Morale (Use all that apply):

- +10 if force is in dominion of their liege
- +10 if they have beaten this foe before
- + 10 if troop class is 2 levels higher than the enemy
- + 30 if attacking an enemy "on the march"
- - 10 if any accompanying force has routed

### 3. Environment (Use all that apply):

- +25 if in extremely favorable environment
- -25 if in extremely unfavorable environment
- +20 if the entire force in a night battle has infirvasion

### 4. Terrain (Use all that apply):

- +20 if higher altitude than opponent
- +20 for halfling force in fields or woods
- +10 for elven force in woods
- +20 for dwarven force in hills or mountains
- -20 for force with mounted troops in mountains, woods, or stronghold
- -20 for force in mire (marsh/mud)\*
- -10 for force on shifting ground (snow/sand)\*

### \* Terrain Modifications (for Defenders Only) (Ignore if all attackers can fly; use only half of adjustment if 5% or more of attackers can fly):

- +10 if defending in place (holding)
- + 50 if defending a narrow defile, pass or bridge
- +40 if attacker must cross deep water

- +20 if defending in mountains, hills, or rough terrain, or behind a wall
- + 50 if force is in a stronghold (see "Sieges")

### 5. Immunities (Use only one per force):

- + 150 if force is immune to enemy's attacks
- + 50 if 1% of force is immune to enemy's attacks
- + 50 if force is immune to 80% of enemy's attacks

### 6. Fatigue (Use only one per force):

- - 10 if force is moderately fatigued
- - 30 if force is seriously fatigued

\* Troops properly equipped and trained or native to the terrain do not suffer the penalty (e.g. Arabs in desert).

### Explanations

**Troop Ratio:** Find the total number of troops in each force, and divide the larger number by the smaller. If the total is 1.01 to 1.5, the 1.5 ratio is used. Only the larger side benefits from this adjustment, and only one benefit applies.

Steeds are only counted as members of a force if their primary function is fighting (such as dragons) and not transportation (such as horses).

**Morale:** This reflects the confidence of a force. Troops that fight in their home territory, that know they can beat an opponent, or are of superior quality to the foe may benefit from one, some, or all of these.

**Condition:** Certain conditions may help or harm a force. Goblins in the daylight are at a disadvantage, as are fire giants in snow.

**Terrain:** In many cases, the ground on which the battle is fought will give an advantage to one side or the other. Apply as many of these modifiers as fit your force; note that some apply only to Defenders.

**Determining Who the "Defender" Is:** If one force has taken a position and waits for the other to come to it, that force is the defender. When two forces arrive at the same location at the same time, they must stop moving. If both forces choose to defend, *neither* gets the defender bonus.

**Immunities:** This reflects the advantage possessed by some creatures who cannot be hit by normal weapons; gargoyle and lycanthropes are some examples.

**Fatigue:** Troops may become fatigued as a combat result of a previous battle (see the War Machine Combat Results Table) or because of a forced march.

### Results

When the BR is modified as described above, each player rolls 4% and adds the modified BR to the result. The total is the combat result. The player with the highest combat result wins.

### Applying Combat Results

When the winner and loser have been identified, determine the effects of the battle (killed, wounded, fatigued, etc.) as follows:

Subtract the loser's combat result from the winner's result. Find this difference in the left-hand column of the War Machine Combat Results Table. Apply the resulting casualties, fatigue, and location to both the winning (W) and losing (L) troops, as noted.

**Casualties:** When subtracting casualties, consider half of them as dead and the other half as wounded. When a force contains mixed troops (such as trolls and goblins), the casualties must be split as evenly as possible between them. If a force retreats from the field, treat all wounded as killed. If a force holds the field after the battle, those wounded troops can return to action in 1d4 months.

**Fatigue:** Troops will remain fatigued for 1d4 days. "Seriously fatigued" troops become "moderately fatigued" in 1d4 days, and will have their strength restored after another 1d4 days.

**Terrain units:** This term represents whatever measure of distance is most appropriate. On a hex or square grid map, this is one hex or square. If no unit of measure seems obvious, use 1 mile. If multiple forces fight and 1 or more forces on each side holds the field, another round of battle may be fought between them. If some of a player's forces have routed or retreated, any that remain may choose to retreat to avoid fighting another battle.

If all of the enemy forces have left the terrain unit occupied by your forces, a day of battle ends. No more fighting occurs until the next day (if applicable).

## Sieges

Extensive siege rules are provided later in this chapter. For simple sieges, here are simpler rules.

A force located inside a fortified structure (walled town, castle, stronghold, etc.) may be attacked by another force, but has a superior position. This is called a "siege." The force within the structure is the defender. If the defender comes out of the structure, unmodified War Machine rules should be used. If the defender remains within the structure, a siege results; use these following additional rules.

**The defender gets the following benefits:**

1. When calculating the troop ratio, multiply the number of defending troops by 4.
2. Combat Results of "Retreat" or "Rout" are ignored by the defender.
3. All defender casualties are reduced by half.

**The attacker has the following options:**

1. The attacker can attack normally, using the above rules, and suffering because the defender is so well emplaced, or
2. The attacker can "besiege" the defender—the attacker surrounds the defenders, keeping them within the structure. This adds +5 to the attacker's BR for each week of the siege. (This represents the building of siege engines, and mining to weaken the defender's position.)

**Special Note:** Some forces have clerics available to magically create food and water. If a besieged defender does not have a cleric, the DM should keep a record of the defenders' food supplies. After these are exhausted, the defender loses 10% of its numbers (nor rating points) per week until the siege ends.

Attack + = forceful attack to overrun

Attack = close and combat

Envelop = attempt to encircle foe

Hold = stand fast at all costs

Withdraw = retreat rather than fight

### Results

Cl, C2, C3: Casualties are increased by 10%, 20%, or 30%.

C-1: Casualties are decreased by 10%.

+10, +25, etc.: Add this number to the force's BR.

-10, -25, etc.: Subtract this number from the force's BR.

NE: The plans cancel, with no effect on the battle.

NC: No combat occurs; no losses are inflicted.

## Optional Rules

The following guidelines can be added to the War Machine mass combat system if desired. They give players the opportunity to control the battles more closely.

### Tactics (Optional)

A good leader will select a plan before committing troops to battle. The success of this plan depends on the opponent's plan.

Each commander (player) chooses a tactic from the Tactics Table. To indicate the choice, place a 6-sided die on the table before you, with the number of your plan facing up. Cover it with one hand until your opponent has also made a choice; then reveal both choices at the same time. Use the Tactics Table to find the results. (Remember that the die is placed to reflect the player's choice; it is not rolled randomly. Written choices can also be used.)

If the result gives only one effect (NE or NC),

that effect is applied to both sides in the battle. If the result is two effects (separated by a slash), the result on the left applies to the "Side A," and the result on the right to "Side B." There is no advantage to being either A or B.

If more than one force per side is involved in the battle, choose one tactic per side, *not* per force.

### Mercy (Optional)

After a battle is fought and casualties have been determined, the winner of the battle can choose to show mercy to the loser. If so, this is declared before the loser's casualties have been subtracted. When mercy is shown, apply the following immediately:

1. The loser's casualties are cut in half.

1. All wounded may be recovered, even if the loser has been driven from the field.

1. A +2 bonus applies to all the loser's future reaction rolls involving the winner (including both leaders).

1. If the loser fights the winner again within 1 year, a -20 penalty applies to the loser's BR.

### Character Actions (Optional)

Some of the actions of player characters can have a great effect on the outcome of a battle. Use the following adjustments to the battle rating (BR). All modifications apply to the total BR of the force.

Information (Use only one per force):

+50 detailed plan, or with traitor or spy

+20 with good reconnaissance

+10 with some reconnaissance

-25 with misinformation

The information must be known to the commander of a side before the battle begins. Use +50 if a plan has been captured, revealing the enemy's preparations, or if an enemy officer supplies the enemy force with information, or if a high-placed spy gives good reports. A single deserting soldier will not provide this benefit.

"Good reconnaissance" means that the entire opposing force has been scouted over several hours, from several different directions. "Some reconnaissance" means that some scouting information has been gathered, but lacks detail. "Misinformation" can be the capture of false plans, or belief in information provided by a double agent, or other unusual circumstances.

### Surprise

+40 with surprise attack from ambush

+20 with surprise attack on encampment

If a character does something exceptional to hide the force (camouflage them, occupy the heights over a narrow pass, etc.), the force has a 50% chance of surprising an enemy that moves into the ambush. If the ambushing force is invisible, the chance is 80%. Other adjustments for night, natural terrain (halflings in woods, for example), or magic should be decided by the DM.

A surprise attack on an encampment requires the elimination of enemy pickets, guards, and any magical protections. If this can be accomplished with a role-playing adventure without raising an alarm, the encamped force can be attacked with surprise.

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_119_Picture_61.jpeg)

Leader Loss:+30 if leader is "removed"  
+10 if other officer is "removed"

"Removed" can mean killed, captured, charmed, put to sleep, or otherwise "removed" from the force before the battle begins. Removing an opposing leader does not count as a heroic task (see "PC Heroics").

An attempt to remove an opposing leader can become a good role-playing adventure. Be sure to allow a good chance of the PCs being "removed" themselves! Also, when a force led by a PC fights one led by an NPC, the enemy may send a group to "remove" the PC.

PC Heroics:+20 if PC leader accomplishes heroic task  
+10 if name level PC (not force leader) accomplishes heroic task  
-20 if PC leader fails heroic task  
-10 if name level PC (not leader) fails heroic task

Only PCs can attempt heroics, and the DM must first create a situation where they may do so. The heroic act must be visible to at least 10% of the PC's force, and the act should be risky (a 50% chance of failure, or worse).

*Example of Heroics:* Fighting a huge and fearsome member of the opposing force (dragon, vampire, etc.); rescuing a "branch force" cut off from the main force; or single-handedly battling a huge enemy force.

Other NotesA normal game session can be played in combination with the War Machine, using the system to determine overall results while focusing the game on the actions of the characters. The shift from role playing to mass combat situations (and back) can be accomplished easily with these guidelines:

1. Damage to PCs: PCs (and major NPCs) are never killed as a result of a War Machine battle. They can be scattered and separated (DM's option), but any attempts to actually damage the characters should be handled in normal game sessions.

2. PC items and spells: If a normal adventure is played, then only the spells and magical item charges actually used are lost. If no adventure is played, determine whether the PC is on the winning or losing side. If on the losing side, all combat spells and two-thirds of the charges in all offensive and defensive magical items are used. If on the winning side, one-third of the applicable magical item charges are used, and the PC keeps 1 combat spell uncast.

3. Experience Points: Experience points are earned both for commanding a force and for performing heroics. If a PC leads a force, find the number of troops in the enemy force. If the PC wins the battle, the PC gets that number of experience points. The PC gets one-third of that number if the battle is lost.

4. Magical Items: A *staff of health* or *rod of victory* can affect a battle and its aftermath, as follows:

*Staff of Health:* If the user holds the field after a battle, up to 500 wounded can be immediately

restored to full strength.

*Rod of Victory:* Add a +25 bonus to the combat roll (to a maximum roll of 100). If the holder loses the battle by a difference of greater than 100, use the "91-100" combat results.

Troop MovementThe following guidelines should be used when moving forces:

ScaleThe scales for time and distance can vary by the size of a force and the distance involved. The standard 24-mile map hex can be used when large forces move over large distances. When opposing forces draw near each other, one move per day is recommended. DMs should try to prepare a detailed map of the area when this occurs.

Movement RateUp to 50 troops can move together at their base movement rate. When more troops are involved, travel slows. Remember that a movement rate is based on the speed of the slowest member of any group.

51-100 troops move at two-thirds their usual rate.

101 or more troops move at half the usual rate.

Movement rates for wilderness travel are discussed in Chapter 6. If you are using a hex map to regulate movement, these rates can easily be applied to the scale of the map. The DM may include a bonus or penalty for easy or rugged terrain, but most situations are covered in the War Machine.

FoodIf a force is carrying food supplies, either on wagons or on individuals, keep track of the supplies. Remember to consider encumbrance when calculating the movement rate.

If a force forages for food, modify the basic rule (see page 89) as follows. The force leader can choose to slow movement to two-thirds the normal rate, with a 2 in 6 chance of finding enough food, or may slow movement to one-third normal, for a 4 in 6 chance of success. Terrain can modify the chances by +1 or -1 at the DM's discretion.

Forced Marches Table

| Troop Class   | Die Roll |     |     |     |     |     |
|---------------|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|               | 1        | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| Untrained     | F        | F+M | F+S | M   | M   | M   |
| Poor          | F        | F+M | F+S | N   | N   | M   |
| Below Average | F        | F+M | F+M | F+S | M   | M   |
| Fair          | F        | F+M | F+M | F+M | N   | N   |
| Average       | F        | F   | F+M | F+M | N   | M   |
| Good          | F        | F   | F+M | F+M | N   | N   |
| Excellent     | F        | F   | F   | F   | F+M | N   |
| Elite         | F        | F   | F   | F   | F+M | F+M |

F: Forced march successful; add 50% to day's movement

M: Force is moderately fatigued\*

S: Force is seriously fatigued

N: No forced march, no fatigue

\* If force is already moderately fatigued, it becomes seriously fatigued with this result.

All results are cumulative; "F + S" indicates that the forced march is successful, but that the force is seriously fatigued afterward.

Without supplies, a force can travel for one day without penalty. After a second day, the force becomes "moderately fatigued." After a third day, the force is "seriously fatigued." A seriously fatigued force cannot move. One day's supply of food removes all of this fatigue (either moderate or serious), but does *not* affect fatigue caused as a combat result.

Forced MarchA force can attempt a forced march to increase its movement rate, but this might not be successful. If it is attempted, find the troop class, roll 1d6, and consult the following table. A force that is "seriously fatigued" cannot attempt a forced march.

ManeuveringWhen the forces of two opposing sides begin to move, the order of movement becomes important. This order is resolved with an initiative roll at the beginning of each time unit. Dexterity adjustments do not apply to this roll.

The player or side with initiative decides whether to move first, or to force the opponent to move first. The player or side chosen moves all of its forces, marking the movement on the map if one is being used. The remaining side then moves. After all movement is complete, forces that are in contact can engage in combat.

If a map is being used, two armies come into contact whenever they enter the same hex, square, or space. Each force must either stop or allow the opponent to attack with the "on the march" adjustment (+30).

If no map is being used, the same effect occurs whenever two forces come within one mile of each other. If either of the forces has at least 5,000 troops, the range for contact is five miles.

Once the forces are in contact, neither force can leave the area without allowing the enemy to attack with the "on the march" modifier *unless*:

a. The loser of a battle is required to retreat farther than the winner can pursue, as indicated by the War Machine Combat Results Table. For example, the F/R+1 and the F+1/R+3 results allow the loser to break contact with the foe; the F/R and F+3/R+2 results do not.

![Illustration of a siege setup, showing a castle tower with a ladder and archers, and a large battle scene below with soldiers fighting.]()![](_page_121_Picture_1.jpeg)

b. If one player chooses the "Withdraw" tactic, and the other player chooses anything except the "Attack +" tactic, the player who chose "Withdraw" may remove his force one terrain unit after the combat is resolved. Retreat results are added to this move if required. A withdrawing unit cannot occupy the field or pursue an opponent, even if the combat result allows this.

## Order of Events in the War Machine

### War Machine Checklist

#### A. When Troops Are Acquired:

1. Divide the troops into separate forces or armies, or decide that they will be one large force.
2. Determine the *basic force rating* (BFR) for each force.
3. Determine the *troop class* for each force.
4. Determine the *battle rating* (BR) for each force.

#### B. When Troops Are Moved:

1. Determine the *movement rate* of each force.
2. Determine a map and time scale (terrain units and time units).
3. Roll for initiative. The winner decides which side moves first.
4. The forces of one side are moved as far as they will travel during one time unit (usually a day or week).

Any forces that must break contact to move can be immediately attacked "on the march." After the battle, they can move normally *unless* they received an "R+" or "Rout" combat result.

1. The forces of the other side are moved as far as they will travel during this time unit. ("On the march" attacks are resolved as given above.)
2. The side with initiative can declare that it is attacking in any and all terrain units where the forces of two sides are in contact. (Resolve with Combat Order of Events.)
3. The side without initiative may attack (as per Step 6; resolve with Combat Order of Events).

#### C. When Troops Fight (Combat Order of Events):

1. Modify each side's BR as given.
2. Modify each side's BR for any campaign considerations.
3. If the optional tactics are used, choose tactics.
4. Roll d $^{\%}$  for each side; add the modified BR to the roll.
5. Use the War Machine Combat Results Table to find the results, and apply them (modified by tactics, if used).

## The Siege Machine

A siege situation is one where an army tries to capture a fortified structure held by another army. When, in the course of a normal D&D®

game, a siege situation crops up, the players and the DM must decide how they want to resolve it. There are three methods:

1. Play a normal game based on the siege.
2. Use the basic War Machine system.
3. Use the Siege Machine.

Play a Normal Game: Each player should review the section on siege equipment from Chapter 4. The siege will probably be a long exercise unless the characters have additional things to do during the siege, or unless the characters have some means to defeat the enemy force in relatively short order.

Use the Basic War Machine: The basic War Machine rules provide simple modifiers for fortifications used in a combat, as described earlier this chapter.

Use the Siege Machine: In this section, we'll describe the Siege Machine rules.

## What the Siege Machine Is

The Siege Machine is a set of expanded War Machine rules for assaults on fortifications. Before using these rules, each player should have detailed information on the following subjects:

- The War Machine system, described earlier this chapter.
- The troops involved (including leaders, normal equipment, and other details needed for the War Machine).
- The defenders' fortification (including thickness and length of walls, height of other constructions, etc.).
- The siege equipment used by both sides, and the number of crewmen operating each (see Chapter 4 for rules on siege equipment).
- The exact monthly cost of mercenary troops hired to fight with the force (see Chapter 11 for information on mercenaries).
- The exact levels of all clerics in or with each force.
- The exact number of full rations available (see "Sustenance," below).

The Siege Machine is played out in turns of one week, also known as siege turns. When the forces within the defensive structure sally forth to attack the besieging force, combat is played out under normal War Machine rules.

## Siege Options

### Attacker's Siege Options

1. *Depart*: The attacking forces leave the battle completely. No further combat occurs.
2. *Bombard*: The attackers maintain a position distant from the fortification but within range of the smallest artillery used. Artillery and ballista fire is the only possible form of combat; no melee or missile fire occurs.
3. *Harass*: The attacking force encamps near the fortification. Some siege equipment may be used, but not all (see "Siege Preparations"). The attacking force is within range of missile fire. Combat is intermittent, in any form except melee.
4. *Assault*: The attacking force uses all available siege equipment and attacks forcefully, trying to penetrate the fortification. The attacking force gains a bonus of +5% (not merely

+5) to its BR, but the defenders' casualties are decreased by 5% (effects identical to the standard tactics). The combat turn is otherwise run normally. Combat is primarily melee, with some missile fire but usually no artillery fire.

### Defender's Siege Options

The defender can at any time choose to leave the fortress to make an assault. If an avenue of escape exists, the defenders may choose to depart. If they remain within the fortification, the defenders harass. Defenders can not bombard the attackers.

If the defenders make an assault, they lose all fortification bonuses but may choose the time of attack (day or night) and gain a +10% (not +10) bonus to their BR (rounded up), which represents a degree of surprise. Combat is otherwise run normally, using the War Machine Combat Results Table (not applying siege modifications). Standard modification for normal tactics are used, but the (former) attacker may choose a new tactic and is not bound by the siege tactic currently being used. (The number of defenders is no longer multiplied by 4.)

If the fortification has a secret exit (possibly underground), the defenders can depart unnoticed. If 10% of the defending force is left to maintain the appearance of strength, the departure of the main force can remain undiscovered for some time, varying by the attacker's current tactic. If the attackers are harassing, the departure becomes apparent one to four hours after dawn. If the attackers are bombarding, the departure will not be noticed. If the attackers are assaulting, the departure is discovered after one turn. The defenders' smaller force may, however, be detected by special squads (see below).

If the defenders' fortification is not surrounded, the defending forces can depart by normal means. If this takes place visibly and during daylight, the attackers gain immediate knowledge and can attack according to normal War Machine rules. If the departure takes place under cover of darkness or invisibility, the defenders can move up to one full terrain unit away from the attackers.

If the defenders depart, the attackers may pursue, occupy the fortification, or do both (by splitting their force). Artillery cannot be moved fast enough to pursue a fleeing force.

## Siege Preparations

Before commencing a siege, the DM and players need to make the following preparations:

1. Find costs for each side: Each player needs to find out the weekly payroll, food and water supplies (sustenance), and ammunition costs of his entire force. Review the detailed notes given for each topic at the end of this section. Each player notes the amount of money, rations, and ammunition he has on hand at the start of the siege.
2. Find BFR, troop class, and BR for each force: Each player privately calculates these details, using the standard War Machine rules.
3. List and compare siege details: The defending player makes a list of the walls, buildings, moat, and other parts of his fortification, plus all unconcealed siege weapons in use. The attacker lists all the unconcealed siege equip-

ment of the attacking force. (See "Concealed Information" for further details.) The lists should *not* include BR values. When finished, the players trade lists, and both players can make notes if desired. At the DM's option, reinforcements can arrive later to aid either the defenders or attackers. In this case, the player receiving the reinforcements should make a second list and re-compute costs, BFR, troop class, and BR bonuses.

1. Calculate total BR bonuses: Both players take back their own lists and privately note the BR bonuses for each item while adding concealed equipment information. The BR bonuses for most siege weapons vary by the number of crew per weapon. The exact number of crew per machine should be noted, along with the BR bonus, to avoid errors.

1. Defender finds total BR score and siege weapon bonuses: The defending player adds the total defense bonus to the original BR score of the force to find the total modified BR. (The score is not revealed at this time.) Additional bonuses for siege weapons will vary by the tactics used by the attacker, but can be calculated at this time as follows:

**Attacker Bombards:** Attacker adds all the bonuses for artillery (catapult and trebuchet), plus half the bonuses for ballistas.

**Attacker Harasses:** Attacker adds double the bonuses for artillery, and adds the full bonuses for ballistas.

**Attacker Assaults:** Attacker adds no value for artillery but adds double the bonus for ballistas.

1. Attacker calculates BR bonus for each tactic: The attacking player privately calculates the siege equipment bonuses that will apply to each tactic chosen, as follows:

**Bombard:** All artillery bonuses apply, plus half the ballista bonuses.

**Harass:** Bonuses for ballista, timber fort, and mannet apply. Some or all artillery bonuses can apply, if the attacker decides to use artillery despite possible casualties to the crew.

**Assault:** All miscellaneous equipment bonuses apply, plus double ballista bonuses. Artillery bonuses may apply, if the attacker decides to use artillery despite the possible casualties.

## Order of Events in Siege Machine

Once all preparations are made, you can conduct siege combat. Each game week (i.e., each siege turn), follow this sequence of events:

1. Deduct costs for the battle week: Ignore this step for the first battle of the siege. Apply it to the second and subsequent battle rolls. If the defending force chooses to harass, siege combat continues unless the attacker departs. Each player deducts costs for the turn as follows:
   1. **Payments:** Cash payments to mercenary troops (one week's payroll) are deducted from each side's total money,
   2. **Sustenance:** Each side deducts one week's food and water from its current stores for all troops not fed by clerical spells.

1. **Ammunition:** Each side deducts one week's amount of ammunition from each siege weapon's total. Both sides can add ammunition gained by gathering (see "Siege Accounting").

1. **Dominion Costs:** If the end of a month occurs at the end of a battle week, each side makes appropriate adjustments to their dominion treasuries, deducting normal costs and adding normal income. However, a ruler under siege cannot receive dominion income. If a secondary ruler has been previously designated, the dominion accounting continues normally.

1. Modify BR for field of battle: The battle modifications for troop ratio, morale, environment, immunities, and fatigue should be done openly (but without revealing the starting BR). Some bonuses for terrain also apply (but see Terrain, below). Remember that when calculating the troop ratio, the number of troops defending a fortification is multiplied by four. Fatigue automatically lasts for one week instead of 1d4 days.

**Terrain:** In the War Machine, some terrain bonuses apply to the defender only. Ignore the following normal bonuses: they are replaced by the more detailed defense bonuses for the fortification, as calculated in the "Siege Preparations" section: defending in place, defending behind a wall, force is in stronghold

1. Choose tactics: Each player chooses one siege tactic (as detailed in #5 below). Possible tactics are depart, bombard, harass, and assault. Though optional in the War Machine, tactics are required for the Siege Machine. Defenders may not bombard.
2. Reveal tactics and modify BR for siege equipment: The tactic used by the attacker is revealed first. If the bombard tactic is used, the defender's tactic is not revealed and he uses the bombard bonuses only. Each player finds the BR bonus that applies (based on the tactics used) and adds the bonus to the BR of the force.
3. Find and apply results: The details for this procedure vary by the attacker's tactic, as follows.

**Bombard:** The attacking player adds the BR bonus gained for artillery and ballista. He then rolls 1d10 to determine casualties inflicted on the defending forces. The resulting roll is read as a percentage (10%, 20%, 30%, etc.) of the BR rating equaling the Hit Dice of casualties inflicted on the defenders. The defender follows the same procedure, but rolls 2d10.

For example, the attacker has 85 BR points of artillery and the defender has 40. The attacker rolls a 5, causing 42/2 Hit Dice of casualties (50% of 85). The defender rolls an 11, causing 44 Hit Dice of casualties (110% of 40).

**Harass:** Each player rolls d%, and adds the result to the BR of the force. The player with the higher total wins this round of the siege. Subtract the lower total from the higher, and refer to the War Machine Combat Results Table to find the resulting casualties and fatigue. (Up to this point, the procedure is identical to that of the War Machine.) Modify the results as follows:

\* These weapons may have wheels attached and be towed. Towing encumbrance = 1/12 the listed encumbrance; thus a horse pulling a mantlet on wheels is pulling only 400 cn.

\*\* All bonuses require that there be 1 piece per 1,000 men in the force.

† The hoist's usefulness depends on the number of crew used. One man can be lifted 10 feet per round per crewman used. Up to six crewmen may be used to operate the device. For every additional man lifted, to a maximum of four men, subtract 10 feet per round.

‡ All bonuses require that there be 1 piece per 100 men in the force. (Greater numbers can multiply the BR bonus up to 5<sup>+</sup> maximum.)

1. All casualties are only one-tenth of normal (drop the last zero in all cases).
2. Both attackers and defenders ignore location changes; a "Rout" or "—" result for fatigue is treated as "S."
3. Defender casualties are half the final percent. If artillery is used, calculate casualties as for bombard.

*Assault:* The procedure used for assault is identical to that for harass, but with the following modifications:

1. Casualties are half of normal.
2. A "Rout" or "—" result indicates that the losers are driven back. If the defenders lose, they are driven out of the fortification. If the attackers lose, they are forced back to a bombarding position.
3. Defender casualties are half the final percent. If artillery is used, follow the bombard procedure.

not even, do not round off; consider the fraction as one wounded casualty. The exact troops to which casualties are applied can be designated for more realism, but this is not required.

**Special Note:** If artillery is used in a War Machine battle (involving no fortifications), double the number of casualties, and apply 100% to the enemy troops.

## Other Details

### Concealed and False Information

In Step 3 of "Siege Preparations," players make lists and compare siege details. Both players may conceal or exaggerate certain details.

**Fortification Details:** The thickness and height of walls, towers, and belfries must be noted, but each player can claim a height or width up to 5 feet different from the actual amount.

**Visible Equipment:** The attacker must reveal the exact and correct number of pieces of visible siege equipment used at the start of the battle. However, more equipment can be brought in later or can be concealed by large structures. The existence of such secret weapons is revealed as soon as they are used, when their bonuses to combat are applied.

**Invisible Equipment:** *Invisibility* used by either side counts towards concealing weapons only if the enemy has no method of detecting invisible objects. If the enemy spots a team of mules pulling invisible siege equipment but cannot detect invisible, the attacker may identify the invisible siege weapon incorrectly.

### Siege Equipment

Chapter 4 contains many details on siege weapons. Here, we'll show you the siege weapon tables again, but in these tables we'll give you the Siege Machine details of these weapons.

These weapons require a crew of at least one-quarter the listed size to be usable. If a crew is less than full, but greater than or equal to half the listed number, the BR+ and the Ammo Cost are half normal. If a crew is reduced below half but not below one-fourth, the Ammo Cost and BR+ are divided by four. Round all fractions down.

## Siege Accounting and Costs

Ammunition: The missiles used by catapults, trebuchets, and ballistas must be accounted for in siege situations. Ammunition may be the largest single cost of the siege.

Before the battle, each player notes the amount of ammunition available for each siege weapon. The weekly costs are given for each such weapon in the equipment details. Costs should be recorded so that one unit equals a week's worth of ammunition. Note that the costs are subtracted from a dominion treasury and may be considered part cash, part services.

In Step 1 of each battle week, both players deduct ammunition to be used in the following turn (week), subtracting 1 (one week's worth) from the total for each siege weapon.

Each player then adds a number to reflect ammunition gathered. Ballista ammunition can never be gathered or reused; all missed shots are broken and unusable. Artillery ammunition can be gathered and reused by each side. The details vary for each side, as follows.

The defending force can only gather a small amount of spent ammunition. The attacker must first reveal the total number of artillery pieces that fired in the previous week. The defender divides that total by 4; the result is the number of weeks of ammunition that the defenders can gather.

## Casualties

Casualties resulting from harass or assault tactics are applied normally. Casualties from artillery bombardment are determined separately, as explained above under bombard.

The casualties from the attacker's artillery may affect both sides, depending on the tactics used by the attacker.

| Bombard | 100% defenders | 0% attackers  |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Harass  | 80% defenders  | 20% attackers |
| Assault | 60% defenders  | 40% attackers |

Divide the total Hit Dice of casualties by the average Hit Dice of the lowest level troops; the result is the actual number of casualties. As with normal casualties, consider half of them as dead and the other half as wounded. If the division is

The defenders may also choose to destroy stone buildings and use the stone for ammunition. This can be done quickly by few men. Each stone building yields a number of units (weeks' worth) of ammunition equal to its BR value. However, the BR bonus for the building must be immediately deducted from the defender's original total.

The attacking force can gather a much larger amount of spent artillery ammunition. Ammunition can only be collected from artillery used in the previous week. The amount varies by the tactic used in the current week.

| Bombard | Three-quarters of the weapons fired |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| Harass  | One-half of the weapons fired       |
| Assault | One-fourth of the weapons fired     |

These figures assume that all available troops are employed in gathering ammunition. Troops so employed do not rest enough to offset fatigue, but do not suffer additional fatigue. If a commander allows the troops to rest to offset fatigue, the amount of ammunition gathered is half as much.

If a missile weapon runs out of ammunition, it gives no further BR bonuses. If a weapon is left unused to save ammunition, its BR bonus is not counted for that week.

Artillery shot can be used in any piece of artillery. For conversion, consider 6 units of light catapult ammunition as equal to 5 units of heavy catapult ammunition, or 4 units of trebuchet ammunition.

Payroll: The standard mercenary payroll (see Chapter 11) is given in cost per month. Divide by four to find the cost per week.

To be used for payroll, cash must be either kept at the siege site or delivered at regular intervals (either procedure requiring guards). Cash must be in a physical form suitable for individual payments; mercenaries cannot be expected to make change. Mercenaries may be given large sums as payment in advance of services, but this practice encourages desertion and often causes a drop in morale (due to gambling, theft, accidental loss, etc.).

Sustenance: A standard ration serves one person for one week, but spoils if kept longer than a week. An iron ration also serves one person for a week, but spoils only if kept for eight weeks. One week's food and water for one person is called a full ration.

The prices listed for food in Chapter 4 reflect the markups applied to food offered to adventurers or sold in taverns and inns. When feeding an army and buying food regularly in bulk, divide those listed food costs in half. This reduced price is not available to small parties of traveling adventurers.

The limiting factor for clerical assistance is the 5th level *create food* spell. Much more water than food can be produced, by the 4th level create water spell. The following table gives the number of men fed by one *create food* spell ("Men per Spell" column) and the total number of men a cleric can sustain if all available spells are used to do so ("Max Men" column). The cleric must provide food daily; none can be stored as the magically-created food spoils within 24 hours.

Some forces have insufficient numbers or levels of clerics to sustain them, and some have

| 17            | 288           | 1,152   | 31            | 792           | 6,336   |
| 18            | 324           | 1,296   | 32            | 828           | 6,624   |

| 21            | 432           | 2,160   | 35            | 936           | 8,424   |
| 22            | 468           | 2,340   | 36            | 972           | 8,748   |
| 23            | 504           | 2,520   |               |               |         |

no clerics at all. Anyone not receiving full rations becomes fatigued: moderate fatigue after one week of less than proper feeding, serious fatigue after another week, becoming weak (losing 50% of BR) after a third week. Morale drops 2 points for each week of less than normal feeding. Troops not fed at all will desert or rebel after only 1-3 days of such treatment.

Horses and other mounts of similar size require double normal (human) rations. Under-feeding brings the same penalties as for troops; if not fed, the mounts may flee, attack their owners, or simply weaken and die (in 4-9 days).

Foraging and hunting are virtually useless for armies. Any force of 100 or more troops can quickly gather every available food source in an area in only a day, providing food for one week at most, and often less.

In Step 1 of each week of siege combat, both players deduct the full rations to be used in the coming week. If less than full rations are issued, fatigue and morale changes are applied immediately. Rations are not deducted for troops supplied by clerics.

#### Special Squads

Either side can use special squads—groups of specialists with exceptional skills who work toward special purposes. Typical purposes are reconnaissance (gathering information about the enemy), demolition (attempting to destroy one or more chosen pieces of equipment), and *commando* (capturing or killing one or more persons valuable to the enemy).

Special squads usually involve magic. A reconnaissance squad might include persons able to fly invisibly, observing enemy forces at close range, or thieves who are able to sneak quietly. A demolition squad is usually formed to destroy siege weapons or a belfry. A commando squad is often formed to remove or capture enemy leaders or magic-users.

Special squads must be created and defined before the start of the siege. Their existence should not be revealed to the opposing player. The members of any special squad must be PCs or named NPCs. War Machine procedures are not applied; these events are played out under normal D&D® rules.

Special squads operate between siege battle weeks. Their activities are played using normal game rules. If the DM is also one of the players in the siege battle, he or she may run the adven-

ture, but should take great care to keep DM knowledge and NPC knowledge separate. Whenever doubt exists, results should be decided in the player's favor.

A group of adventurers can become a special squad for a siege. This is an ideal way to play a normal D&D game within the siege system.

The results of a special squad's mission are applied immediately, before the next siege battle. For example, actions by a special squad that result in the loss of several siege weapons, leaders, clerics, etc., may require the recalculation of any or all combat details (from troop BR onwards).

#### Field Construction

Siege equipment can be constructed at the site of the siege. Each piece of equipment must be constructed under the supervision of a siege engineer. An artisteer is also needed for any artillery under construction. One siege engineer can supervise up to four constructions at one time. One artisteer can supervise only two constructions at once.

To construct equipment, hardware (metal materials and tools) must be brought to the siege site. The cost of hardware is 10% of the listed cost of the piece of equipment.

Wood must be in plentiful supply at or near the siege site. If a forest resource is within 5 miles, 10 men can gather enough wood in one day to make 5 hit points of equipment. If the wood is 5-10 miles away, double the time. If 10-15 miles away, triple the time, and if 15-20 miles away, quadruple the time needed.

Nearby wooden buildings can be a source of some usable wood. Five feet of building wall can be converted into 1 hit point of equipment. (This assumes the use of rafters and beams as well as the walls themselves.) Stone buildings (with wooden roofs) can also yield usable beams, but only 5 hit points of equipment per standard stone building.

Once materials are at hand, any supervised but untrained person can construct 1/2 hit point of equipment per day. The maximum number of workers that can be used is equal to half the hit points of the finished equipment. For example, if six men work on a light catapult under proper supervision, they will finish 3 hit points per day, taking six days to complete an 18 hit point catapult. No more than nine men can work on it at once.

Ballista ammunition cannot be built in the field except by an armorer.

## Post-Siege Adjustments

**Damage to Fortifications:** If siege missiles are used during a siege, fortifications suffer a certain amount of damage. To determine the state of the walls, towers, and other parts of the fortification, make a damage roll for each attacker siege weapon in use at the end of the siege (example:  $1d8 + 8$  for light catapult). Add all of these damage rolls together. Multiply the result by the number of weeks that the siege lasted. The defender then rolls d% and subtracts the result from the attacker's total. The result is the number of hit points of damage to the fortification.

If the total damage exceeds the original hit points, the fortification is completely reduced to rubble. Otherwise, first apply damage to 75% of the wall's hit points, and (if any damage needs further accounting) to the following structures, in the order given. Deduct 20% of each structure's original hit points each time. If further damage needs accounting, apply 20% more damage to the walls and each item on the following list, in order, going through the list as many times as necessary:

gatehouses, gates, and drawbridges

normal buildings

towers

barbicans

keeps

**Attacks Against a Portion of a Fortification:** If an attacker wishes to concentrate his assault against a small portion of a fortified position, he can do so under the following conditions:

1. The attacker can use no more than 300 troops and four siege engines per 100 feet of attack frontage.
2. The defender gets the full BR benefit from the section of the fortification under attack. He also gets the full BR benefit for any towers with 200 feet of the area under attack. The defender then adds in one-quarter of the BR benefit for the remaining parts of the fortification.

## Additional Details

These notes are offered as historical information, to stimulate the imagination and give a

more detailed view of medieval siege warfare.

The siege section of the War Machine already reflects the assumption that some or all siege weapons are being employed, and that some appropriate defenses are at hand and likewise used. For fast resolution of any assault on a fortification (whether walled town or huge fortress), you can still use that system.

However, not all attacks on fortresses will result in sieges. This is especially true if powerful magic-users are present, for magic can produce very fast results. When both sides have powerful magic-users, the battle could be quickly resolved in either direction, depending on the tactics used. The War Machine rules are inadequate for such cases. A game session devoted entirely to this sort of battle is recommended.

If a long siege situation does arise, one important point should be emphasized: the costs of paying one's forces and maintaining supplies for their use should be strictly applied throughout any siege. Cost was historically (and should remain, in the game) the greatest obstacle to siege warfare.

A character's experience point total determines his experience level. The more experience points a character has, the higher his level and the more powerful he is. Consequently, experience is a very important element of the game. Only through the acquisition of experience points can characters improve their abilities; without experience, the characters would forever be frail and weak.

In the game, there are five normal ways for player characters to acquire experience:

1. By Role-Playing Well
2. By Achieving Party Goals
3. By Defeating Monsters and Opponents
4. By Acquiring Treasure
5. By Performing Exceptional Actions

We'll talk about these five methods one by one and then discuss the rate at which characters should gain experience points and levels. Each method has a rate of experience gain listed; this is the standard rate recommended for the game. We'll talk about options the DM has to change the proportions of experience gain by increasing the importance of some actions and decreasing that of others.

## Experience From Role-Playing

When a player performs an exceptional and appropriate piece of role-playing, you can award him an experience! bonus equal to one-twentieth (1/20) the base number of points he needs to get to the next level.

When players role-play their characters exceptionally well, the DM can give their characters extra experience points. Some types of exceptional role-playing include:

**Good Alignment Play:** Points are awarded in a situation where the character's friends demand that he do something, and it's much simpler, more convenient, and more profitable for him to do that thing, but he follows the dictates of his alignment or established personality.

**Exceptional Heroism or Sacrifice:** Awards can go to the character who is fully aware that he's likely to suffer greatly from his decision, and if given the option to run away or escape unscathed, makes the hard decision and performs an act of great sacrifice or bravery. In such a case, you may want to give the character an experience point bonus. But be careful! When a character is sure he's going to win the encounter, he's not being heroic or self-sacrificing. When a character knows he can be resurrected easily, he's not being heroic if he faces death. Only when the character knows that he's likely to suffer greatly for his action is it heroism or sacrifice, and so the DM has to evaluate each "noble" action in that light.

**Other Exceptional Role-Playing:** Finally, whenever a player performs some role-playing that really impresses the DM, the DM can award him some extra experience. Such a demonstration of role-playing might be an emotional encounter with an NPC, reacting to the loss of a loved one, spontaneously composing a speech

that motivates the army of NPCs and improves their morale, and so forth. If the demonstration of role-playing enlivens the game, impresses the DM, or makes for a very memorable scene, the DM may decide to give the player a bonus.

The bonus given to the character should be about one-twentieth the points it takes him to get from his current level to the next. Don't use his current experience point total; use the base number.

**Example:** Dredian is a 5th level fighter. His player has just pulled off an impressive piece of role-playing and deserves a reward. The DM ignores Dredian's actual experience point total and looks at the experience point table for fighters. It says it takes a fighter 16,000 experience points to get from level 5 to level 6. One-twentieth of that is 800; the DM awards Dredian 800 experience points.

A character should not receive more than one such bonus in a single play session, even if he role-plays well throughout the session.

## Experience From Achieving Goals

When the characters achieve a major goal, award them experience equal to the XP Value of monsters defeated in reaching that goal.

When characters achieve the principal goal of an adventure or campaign, the DM should give them experience bonuses. Normally, this bonus should be equal to the experience point total the characters received for all the monsters they defeated in the course of that story line.

For this reason, it's a good idea for the DM to keep track of the encounters the characters have had in the course of a protracted story line. That way, he'll find it much simpler to recalculate this experience bonus.

## Experience From Monsters

Add XP Value of all monsters defeated; divide by number of characters who participated in their defeat; award the result in XP to each character who participated.

Characters earn experience points by defeating monsters and other opponents. Defeating a monster doesn't necessarily mean killing it; defeating an opponent can mean killing it, capturing it, tricking it into destroying itself, trapping it forever so that it can't menace the rest of the world, and so forth.

To calculate how much experience characters get from combat encounters, follow these steps:

1. Find the description of the monster defeated in Chapter 14.
2. At the bottom of the monster statistics is a line for the monster's "XP (Experience Point) Value."
3. Take this number and multiply it by the number of monsters defeated.

1. Divide the result by the number of player characters and NPCs who participated in the defeat of the monster(s). A character does not have to have done well against the monster; he need only have tried. Characters who die are awarded their share of points, too. They'll need the points if raised from the dead, and this rule helps deter characters from coveting their fallen comrades' experience points.
2. The result is the number of experience points that each of the participating PCs and NPCs gains from the encounter.
3. If the characters valiantly fought but did not defeat the monsters—i.e., they were chased off or defeated and captured—the characters receive only one-fourth (1/4) of the calculated experience points.

If the encountered monster is not listed in Chapter 14, follow this procedure instead:

1. Find the monster's base Hit Dice and the number of asterisks beside its Hit Dice. Ignore asterisks you find anywhere else; only the ones by the Hit Dice number have any relevance. (If this is a monster you've created yourself, give it one asterisk for each significant magical ability it has. If the monster is a character, use his experience level for Hit Dice. If he has magical items, give him one asterisk for every combat ability he has from a magical item; if he has magic spells, give him an asterisk for every two spell levels he has memorized, rounding up (thus a character with 7th level spells would have four asterisks.)
2. Compare the monster's Hit Dice and number of asterisks to the Experience Points for Monsters table. Use the table to calculate how many experience points the monster is worth.
3. Repeat the process for every other monster the characters encountered in this incident. (If all the monsters are of the same type, you only need calculate the number once and then multiply it by the number of identical monsters present.)
4. Add all these numbers together.
5. Perform steps 4-7 from the list immediately above this one.

## Asterisks and Special Abilities

One asterisk is placed by the Hit Dice of a monster for each of its special abilities. Generally, a special ability is a power that can be used in melee, but which is not characteristic of basic survival skills. For example, a flying creature does not get an asterisk for good maneuverability, but it may have a swoop ability.

Any creature able to cast spells gains one asterisk for each two spell levels that it can memorize (round up; a magic-user who can memorize up to 3rd level spells gets 2 asterisks). A spellcaster's experience level is used for the calculation, instead of his or her Hit Dice.

If a creature has magical items with attack powers, add one ability for each combat ability of such an item. Defensive and miscellaneous effects should add no asterisks unless they have some real effect on the encounter.

Any creature with spell-like attack powers

gains one asterisk for each such power. For example, the wight's ability to drain experience levels is a spell-like attack power. Again, defensive or miscellaneous spell-like powers do not normally add asterisks, though certain exceptional defenses may do so.

## Modifying XP Values

You may modify the experience point value of any creature if it proves tougher or easier to defeat than its abilities would indicate. For example, defeating a 36th level magic-user would normally bring a total of 35,000 experience points. It would be counted as a 36 HD creature (base 6,250 XP) that can use up to 9th level spells (5,750 XP per asterisk times 5 asterisks = 28,750 XP). But if the party *disintegrates* him by surprise before he can cast a single spell, they should earn less XP—for instance, the base 6,250 experience points, with the characters receiving no points for the victim's spell powers.

The DM can add or subtract asterisks for exceptional defenses *relative to the PCs' party*. For example, a gargoyle gets one bonus for its immunity to normal weapons, since low-level characters (its usual foes) are usually equipped with few, if any, magical weapons. But when high-level characters face gargoyle, this defense is no longer exceptional; the DM may accordingly decide to remove the asterisk bonus.

## Experience From Treasure

Each 1 gp value of treasure won by a character = 1 XP earned by the character.

Wealth (coins, gems, jewelry and other items of value) is worth experience points. The amount of treasure found will help determine how fast the characters advance through experience levels.

At the end of each adventure, the characters earn experience points based on the actual value of all treasures they have found and kept. If they've sold or traded newly-won treasures, they get experience points based on the money they received, not the theoretical worth of the traded treasure.

Characters will find that the very valuable, portable treasures such as gems and jewelry are much preferable to bulging sacks of gold coins; they are far more efficient, in experience earned for encumbrance carried, than ordinary coin. On the other hand, characters should take what they can get; the DM decides what sorts of monetary treasures are awarded in his campaign.

## Types of Treasure

Treasure whose value counts toward experience includes:

1. Treasure taken from defeated monsters and opponents.
2. Rewards bestowed on the characters for accomplishing dangerous tasks.
3. Money paid to characters for accomplishing dangerous tasks.
4. (Thieves only) Money gained from thieving abilities such as pickpocketing.

Salaries for ordinary jobs do not count toward a character's experience points. Characters only get experience from money obtained during dangerous or challenging experiences.

## Experience and Magical Items

We don't recommend that you award characters full experience point value for the sale of their magical items. Sale of a rare item may bring a character vast amounts of unearned experience, and upset the balance of your game; it would also give one character a lot more experience points than the amount received by characters who don't sell their magical items, which could upset other players.

If a character sells a magical item, first find out how much it costs to create the item (you'll find that in the rules for creating magical items in Chapter 16). The sale price will be at least twice that gold piece amount, but the experience points gained by the character will be a maximum of 10% of the money value it took to create the magical item in the first place. The DM may reduce the amount of experience points still further if he thinks the character is profiting unfairly.

## Experience From Exceptional Actions

When a player performs an exceptional action, the DM can award his character an experience bonus equal to one-twentieth (1/20) the base points he needs to get to the next level.

The DM can award experience bonuses to characters who perform "exceptional actions" that don't belong to any of the categories above. The DM has to decide what constitutes an exceptional action in your campaign. As a rule of thumb, an exceptional action is a success that the character achieves when the DM didn't think he could, or didn't anticipate the clever means by which he achieved it. There is no limit to the number of types of exceptional action in a campaign. The only rule of thumb you can use is this: If a player character tries something that is unexpected, impresses the DM and other players, does good for himself and his friends, and succeeds, then you should count it as an exceptional action.

The standard award for an exceptional action is the same as it was for exceptional role-playing: one-twentieth of the base experience points it takes the character to get from his current level to the next level.

Two common types of exceptional actions include saving allies from harm and exceptional skill use.

## Saving Allies From Harm

This type of exceptional action takes place when the PCs encounter a situation where the Dungeon Master fully expects them to be seriously hurt, and yet a character manages to save them from that fate in an unexpected and unlikely way.

For example, the PCs wander into a nest of vampires. A nasty fight is expected, and as the PCs walk in, the vampires rise out of their coffins. Suddenly, before any combat starts, one PC steps forward and announces that the PCs are representatives of a famous evil lord who wants to forge an alliance with the vampires, and if the vampires attack they're sure to miss out on a great opportunity for mutual gain. While the vampires listen in interest, he spins a clever story about a way by which the imaginary lord's minions and the vampires can take over this entire region of the country. The DM rolls for the vampires' reactions and finds them very positively disposed to the PC's offer. The PC arranges for another meeting in another place, and the PCs leave.

Now, the player character who wove this lovely tale of lies has done something very good. He kept his friends from being hurt in this surprise encounter, and he's set things up so that they can fight the vampires at a time and place of their own choosing. This is an exceptional action, and he should most certainly be rewarded for it.

## Bonuses for Exceptional Skill Use

Characters can earn experience bonuses for exceptional use of their special character-class skills and abilities. Normal, everyday use of these skills should not earn bonuses, but deliberate use of those skills in exceptionally difficult situations could.

For example, a thief could discover that a room has a very intricate trap on it; he knows he'll make his Remove Traps skill check at a dangerous minus and could be seriously wounded or even killed if he fails it. In such a case, the DM could award him a bonus if he deliberately takes on the task he knows is dangerous and successfully disarms the trap.

## Rate of Experience Gain

On the average, characters should go up one experience level approximately every five adventures. At that speed, level advancement doesn't come easily enough to cause boredom, but isn't rare enough to cause frustration.

Various factors can adjust that rate of experience gain. Are most of the characters magic-users or elves, who require more experience points than most other classes? They might go up an average of once every six or seven adventures. Do you play two short games a week instead of one long one? Characters might go up a level once every eight to ten adventures instead. Do you play once a month or less?

You might think about adjusting experience gains so they go up a level once every two games, so that the players don't become frustrated by their slow rate of progress.

## Maximum Rate of Experience Gain

A character cannot gain more than one level of experience in one adventure, regardless of how many experience points are awarded. When a character is awarded enough experience points to gain two levels, trim his awarded experience points so that his experience point total stops just one point short of the amount needed for the next level of experience that he would have gained. Be on the alert if characters are going up as much as an experience level per adventure: It is a sign that the DM is giving out far too many experience points, most likely through the awarding of treasure experience.

## Maximum Hit Points

The DM should always insist on seeing the player roll the die to gain his character's new hit points when the character goes up a level, and be aware of the maximum number of hit points that characters can possibly have. The maximum hit points possible for any human character is a combined total of the roll of nine Hit Dice, any Constitution bonuses, and the given hit point gains for additional levels. For an 18 Constitution and maximum die rolls, these totals are shown in the Maximum Hit Points (Humans) Table.

Maximum Hit Points (Humans) Table

|            | Dice Rolls | Con Bonus | Maximum Hit Points |        |        |
|------------|------------|-----------|--------------------|--------|--------|
| Cleric     | 54         | 27        | Lvl 15             | Lvl 25 | Lvl 36 |
| Fighter    | 72         | 27        | 87                 | 97     | 108    |
| Magic-user | 36         | 27        | 111                | 131    | 153    |
| Thief      | 36         | 27        | 69                 | 79     | 90     |
|            |            |           | 75                 | 95     | 117    |

Hit points for the mystic are the same as those for a fighter, but the mystic has a maximum experience level of 16; the maximum hit point total for mystics is 113. Hit points for the druid are the same as those for a cleric.

Hit points for demihumans are limited by their maximum levels: halfings 8th level; elves 10th level; dwarves 12th level. Halfings and elves use a Hit Die of 1d6 per level, and dwarves roll 1d8; thus, with 18 Constitution, the most possible hit points for maximum level demihumans are:

Maximum Hit Points (Demihumans) Table

|          | Dice Rolls | Con Bonus | Lvl 10-12 | Maximum |
|----------|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Dwarf    | 72         | 27        | +9        | 108     |
| Elf      | 54         | 27        | +2        | 83      |
| Halfling | 48         | 24        | —         | 72      |

Note that a halfling can have about half as many hit points as a fighter, a dwarf can be as tough as a 36th level cleric, and elves and magicians have similar numbers of hit points at maximum level.

## Paths to Immortality

This subject will be explained in greater detail in Chapter 15, but you should know some general details at this time.

After reaching level 26 or greater, a character can attempt to gain Immortality. Immortality is just what it sounds like: eternal youth coupled with great power.

In some campaigns, Immortality is basically a character reward upon the character's retirement; when the character achieves Immortality, he's retired from play. In other campaigns, the focus of the campaign shifts to its Immortal characters.

Characters achieve Immortality by following one of four paths:

A dynasty is a character who builds a great and powerful empire. The dynasty must be vast, and must stand for a long time.

A hero (or epic hero) is a character who represents the ultimate ideals of heroism. The character must display the traits of the classic epic hero in every thought and action. Among other things, the character must travel to far lands and perform great and noble deeds.

A paragon is a character who reaches the ultimate in his or her profession. The paragon must invent or discover new skills and knowledge, and must be renowned as a master professional.

A polymath is a character who learns much about everything, not only in the original profession, but in all areas. The character must give up all known skills before gaining others, and become a member of a mysterious and unique brotherhood.

Following the paths listed above is not enough to insure Immortality, but it gives a focus to the lives of mortals. Complete and utter conviction to the tenets of their empires, professions, and beliefs open the ultimate pathways to the power and the gift of Immortality.

## Creating High-Level Player Characters

There are times when you will want a player to create a new character who starts at higher than 1st level. This situation usually comes up in one of the following circumstances:

1. When the DM believes that 1st level characters are too weak or unskilled for the type of campaign he wants to run. The desired campaign may be high-action and high-danger, or based on a movie or book where the characters are all very powerful. Third level or higher is a recommended starting experience level.
2. When the new character is joining an older, established, high-level group of PCs due to the death of an older character. It is recommended that his starting experience level be anywhere from half the level of the least-experienced existing character to two experience levels below the least-experienced existing character.
3. When the DM wants to run a D&D® game module written for high-level characters, or an adventure of his own creation for high-level PCs, but none of the characters in his campaign is at that level. In this case, whatever is indicated on the cover of the module is the appropriate level to play.

In cases such as these, it's perfectly appropriate to start off characters at higher than 1st level. But be warned: If the DM allows inexperienced players to do so, he must be careful that the game does not degenerate into a series of combat exercises with little real role playing and altogether too much rules-searching. If you and your players want to give high-level play a try, use the following system to generate high-level characters that can easily fit into your campaign. Review the whole procedure carefully before starting.

## Step 1: Choose a Class

The player must first choose a race and profession for the character. The DM may disallow certain classes depending on the needs of the campaign, the adventure, or other limitations. The player should choose his character's name and alignment at this time; the latter may be dictated by the choice of class.

# Chapter 10: Experience

![Decorative header image]()![](_page_129_Picture_2.jpeg)

## Step 2: Generate Ability Scores

The DM may require the player to make random 3d6 rolls as with beginning characters, but this arbitrary method may result in conflicts with the class chosen. Instead, you might think about using one of these methods to generate ability scores:

### First Method: Rolling And Assigning Scores

The player rolls 3d6 eight times and keeps the six best scores. These scores he assigns to his character's abilities in whatever order he chooses. If, for instance, he chose for his character to be a fighter, he'll probably assign the best scores to Strength, Constitution and Dexterity.

### Second Method: Point Allocation

The DM may also give the player a point total and allow the player to choose specific ability scores to fit the character being created. The DM could give each player 60 + 5d6 points (that is, the player rolls 5d6, adds 60 to the total, and gets that as his number of points), or could give each player an equal number of points—at least 60, but no more than 90. The player assigns these points to his character's abilities. Of course, the range limitation of 3 to 18 for ability scores still applies.

## Step 3: Note Bonuses and Penalties Based on Ability Scores

Use the Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores table in Chapter 1 (page 9) to determine bonuses and penalties derived from ability scores.

## Step 4: Determine Character Level and XP Total

The DM decides the experience level at which the character starts. He should decide by gauging what character levels his adventures require; if he doesn't want all the characters to start at exactly the same level, he could vary the character range by a random 1d4 die roll. For example, if he needs characters close to 22nd level, the DM could tell each player to roll 1d4 and add 20 to it for his character's level; the characters would then be from levels 21 to 24.

If the campaign already has high-level PCs and new PCs are joining them, the characters should start no higher than two levels below the lowest-level existing PC. DMs should be sure that the introduction of new experienced PCs will not anger the players who've slowly and painfully built their characters up through the experience levels.

Remember that demihumans gain special bonuses at specific amounts of experience.

## Step 5: Find Current Cash Total

Assign each new character cash equal to 1% of his experience points in gold pieces. This money is not used for purchasing items. It is the amount the character has left over when fully equipped, and

we'll deal with equipping the characters below.

DMs may adjust the percentage to fit your campaign, but the amount should be a function of the experience point total. If characters are poor in this campaign (through taxes, thieves, etc.), the percentage may be as low as 1/10 of 1% of the experience point total. If Dungeon Masters wish these new characters to buy strongholds with their own coins (instead of simply assigning them estates as part of their pre-campaign backgrounds), you might increase the percentage up to 25% of the experience point total.

## Step 6: Find Total Hit Points

Have each player, within your sight, roll his character's hit points up to Name level (8th level for halfflings, 9th level for all other characters). Any human, dwarf, or elf character gets nine rolls; a halfing gets eight.

High-level characters, having survived for a long time, usually have greater than average hit points. The DM may account for this by allowing any roll of 1 to be treated as a 2; he might even extend this by treating 2s as 3s instead.

Another method is to calculate the average number of hit points per die ( $2 rac{1}{2}$  for d4,  $3 rac{1}{2}$  for d6, and  $4 rac{1}{2}$  for d8), add  $1 rac{1}{2}$ , and multiply that result by the number of Hit Dice. For example, a 9th level fighter has nine d8 rolls; take the  $4 rac{1}{2}$  for d8, add  $1 rac{1}{2}$  for a total of 6, and multiply that by 9; the character would therefore have a base of 54 hit points.

After finding the total hit points from die rolls, modify it according to the Constitution bonus or penalty. Take the adjustment for the Constitution, multiply it by the number of dice rolled by the character (nine times for most classes, eight times for halfflings), and add it to the hit point total. For example, a fighter with a Constitution of 15 gets a bonus of +2 hit points for nine levels, or 18 additional hit points.

Add the bonus hit points gained for each level above Name level. Hit point bonuses above 9th level are *not* modified by Constitution.

**Cleric:** 9d6 (9-54 hit points) plus Constitution bonuses, +1/level thereafter. Average per die: 3 1/2.

**Fighter:** 9d8 (9-72 hit points) plus Constitution bonuses, +2/level thereafter. Average perdie: 41/2.

**Magic-user:** 9d4 (9-36 hit points) plus Constitution bonuses, +1/level thereafter. Average per die: 2 1/2.

**Thief:** 9d8 (9-36 hit points) plus Constitution bonuses, +2/level thereafter. Average per die: 2 1/2.

**Dwarf:** 9d8 (9-72 hit points) plus Constitution bonuses, +3/level thereafter up to 12th level. Average per die: 4 1/2.

**Elf:** 9d6 (9-54 hit points) plus Constitution bonuses, +1 at 10th level. Average per die: 3 1/2.

**Halfing:** 8d6 (8-48 hit points) plus Constitution bonuses. Average per die: 3 1/2.

**Druid:** As cleric up to the point at which the character becomes a druid, +1/level thereafter.

**Mystic:** 9d6 (9-54 hit points) plus Constitution bonuses, +2/level thereafter. Average per die: 3 1/2.

## Step 7: Choose Normal Equipment

A high-level character should be given any nonmagical items he desires, within reason. A powerful character would have acquired a lot of property in the course of a long and fruitful career. The player should eventually make a complete list of all these items, but a partial list will suffice for the moment. Note that characters keep many common supplies in storage and don't carry them around on adventures.

The DM may wish to forbid or limit certain large or unusual items (sailing vessels, castles, etc.), but remember that high-level characters often own such things. If the DM decides, for any plot-related reason, that the character has any outstanding debts (either ones he owes or ones owed to him), he must inform the player.

### Alternate Equipping Method

Alternatively, the DM may give each character an amount of cash (such as 20,000 gp total, or 1,000 gp per experience level) to spend on nonmagical supplies. The DM may set the prices of supplies to suit the campaign, making some items common, therefore cheap, and other items rare and expensive.

## Step 8: Find Magical Equipment

Any character of Name level or greater should possess several magical items. The exact number depends on your style of play and personal preferences. Here are two methods to find the number and type of magical items a new high-level character possesses. One or the other of these two methods should work in most campaigns.

### Method One: Buying

All characters get a number of gold pieces equal to their number of experience points. This money is to be spent on magical items alone. Give the players a list of available magical items. The price for each item may be determined using the following list. A player may spend his funds for any number and type of magical items.

This method is the most popular. A player may choose to buy a very powerful item (*a staff of wizardry*, for example), paying an exorbitant price for it, and taking fewer items overall as a consequence. The buying method allows for great freedom in developing a character.

The DM can use the following Magical Item Price Ranges Table to help decide the price of each magical item. Or, the following rule of thumb may be used to help determine the price:

1. Determine the type of item and begin with the base price,
2. For every plus or combat bonus, add the base price to the current total,
3. For every spell-like ability, determine what the equivalent spell's level would be and add the base value for each level,
4. If the ability is phenomenal (such as a *wish*), add 100,000 gp to the value,
5. For every charge possessed, add one-tenth of the base price.

**Magical Item Price Ranges Table**

| Armor              | 10,000 to 500,000 gp |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Miscellaneous Item | 5,000 to 750,000 gp  |
| Miscellaneous      |                      |
| Weapon             | 5,000 to 250,000 gp  |
| Missile            | 1,000 to 5,000 gp    |
| Missile Device     | 10,000 to 250,000 gp |
| Potion             | 1,000 to 10,000 gp   |
| Ring               | 10,000 to 250,000 gp |
| Rod                | 25,000 to 500,000 gp |
| Scroll             | 5,000 to 75,000 gp   |
| Shield             | 5,000 to 100,000 gp  |
| Staff              | 15,000 to 300,000 gp |
| Sword              | 5,000 to 500,000 gp  |
| Wand               | 5,000 to 150,000 gp  |

Note that this set of prices is somewhat inflated from the price ranges you'll see in the rules for magical item creation in Chapter 16. The prices in that chapter, even doubled to reflect sales price, are more reasonable for use in a campaign, while the prices here are more appropriate for this method of equipping new characters with magical items.

**Method Two: Assortment**Each player may take a number (selected by the DM) of potions, scrolls, wands (or staves or rods), rings, miscellaneous items, armor and shield, and weapons. The strengths (plusses) are determined, where applicable, by a d100 roll using the appropriate tables in Chapter 16. The assortment method gives all characters a fairly even starting point. On the average, a character has a number of magical items equal to half of his or her level of experience, half of which are permanent magical items.

Though this may seem quite generous, remember that a high-level fighter (for example) often has a set of magical armor, a magical shield, one or two permanent magical weapons, and a few temporary ones (usually missiles)—plus a few potions, a useful scroll or two (often protection), a ring, and possibly a few miscellaneous magical items.

The actual types and functions of most of the magical items should be known by the player. Assume that all cursed or otherwise harmful items have been discovered and appropriately cleansed or disposed of. The DM may indicate the number of charges remaining in applicable items such as wands, but should only give approximate numbers—the DM should tell the player how many charges remain within a plus or minus 10% range, to cause uncertainty. For example, a player could know that a wand has approximately 50 charges, but he should be unsure of the exact number.

When in doubt as to the amount of magic to give out, be stingy. If characters have too little magic, the DM can always add more during an adventure. It is far more difficult to take away items already in play.

**Step 9: Calculate Armor Class, Saving Throws, and Attack Rolls**Use the standard means to determine these pieces of information. Armor class can be found

in Chapter 1, while saving throws are given in each character class description. Attack rolls are readily available from the standard table in Chapter 8.

**Step 10: Note Special Abilities**The player should review all the abilities of the character's class. A cleric's turn undead abilities along with spells, special fighter techniques, magic-user spells, thief skill percentages, and demihuman special abilities should be written down on a player record sheet.

Note other special abilities from any optional rules you may be using. Such special abilities include weapon mastery and general skills (Chapter 5) and wrestling rating (Chapter 8).

Review and note down pertinent details on all magical items owned and spells known.

**Spell Books**For magic-users, the DM must decide which spells the character knows and record them in the character's spell book. A magic-user should have at least one more spell (at each spell level) in the book than the character can cast per day.

For example, a 26th level magic-user can memorize four 8th level spells, so the character should have at least five 8th level spells in his or her spell book.

Elf characters can gain more spells for their spell books even after they peak at 10th level. For an elf's spell book, find the elf's equivalent level (comparing the elf's experience points to those of a magic-user and give the same number of spells as for a magic-user, but only give spells through level 5, the maximum that an elf can memorize). In addition, an elf character may have scrolls of higher-level spells. The DM can add a 10% chance of failure whenever an elf uses a scroll with a spell of 6th level or higher.

**Step 11: Reveal Campaign Details**The DM may choose to prepare a detailed background for each new character. The character may be on a special quest, or perhaps affected by a curse or other external force. The DM should also list current rumors, mysteries, or clues of which the player character is aware.

The DM should create any retainers associated with the PC. If the character is a ruler, the DM should have a general idea of the location of the character's castle and the size, location, population, and resources of the domain.

Using these basic domain details (see Chapter 12), you can quickly calculate the net monthly incomes (resource, tax, and standard). For an established domain, assume that the current treasury total is equal to three months' unmodified income. The domain confidence level starts at 250 (average). If the character rules lesser domains, the DM should determine their details.

**Retainers**A character may gain retainers whose combined experience levels total the character's as long as: (a) no retainer's level is greater than half

that of the character; (b) the retainers are of the same general class as the PC (such as fighter retainers for a paladin or knight); (c) the number and morale of such retainers may not exceed that determined by the character's Charisma score.

Retainers should have a full complement of common equipment, including mounts. All the costs of finding and hiring them have already been paid. Any magical equipment must be purchased by the player character as part of the magic chosen by the character in Step 8.

**Troops**Any ruler may have a standing army. Other characters may have a group of mercenaries, but only with the special permission of the local ruler. The number of troops may be no greater than four times the character's level in total Hit Dice. These troops have normal weapons, have trained with the PC for 13 weeks or less, and have less than 2 Hit Dice each, with officers having 1 more Hit Die.

The cost of hiring, equipping, and training these basic troops is considered to have already been paid. The player must pay from his available cash for higher-level troops or officers, better equipment or training, mounts, missile fire ability, flying ability, magic, etc. As soon as the character starts play, normal costs (such as monthly expenses for support) begin.

Use the War Machine mass combat system from Chapter 9 to calculate the troop class and battle rating of the force. If mass combat occurs, use either the War Machine or, for game campaigns using 25mm miniatures, the BATTLESYSTEM™ Miniatures Rules to resolve it.

**Step 12: Establish Character Background and Personality**The player may want to create the following details of the character's background:

Place and time of birth

Social and financial status of parents

Early training and cultural exposure

Times, locations, and results of noteworthy adventures

Recent conflicts, successes, etc.

The player should also think about ways to establish and develop the character's personality, including such factors as:

Physical attributes

Mental attitudes

Likes and dislikes

Personal quirks

Lifestyle

Preferred companions

Preferred weapons and methods of combat

Ambitions, hopes, goals, and future plans

He should discuss all these choices with the DM and even with the other players, so that they can establish prior links and relationships between all the new characters.

With all that accomplished, the new high-level characters can begin play.

# Chapter 11: Nonplayer Characters

Nonplayer characters belong to a number of different categories: retainers, mercenaries, specialists, etc. This chapter will deal with all these types of NPCs.

## Retainers

A retainer is a person hired by a character to help on an adventure or a series of adventures. Retainers are sometimes called "hirelings." Retainers are never characters run by players; retainers are always NPCs run by the DM.

The DM may prefer that PCs not hire retainers in his campaign. This decision is especially common when there are plenty of PCs to accomplish the campaign's adventures, or when the player characters are strong enough to handle the adventure's dangers. In games with only a few players or with weak and inexperienced characters, the DM usually permits the PCs to hire retainers.

## Hiring Retainers

When the PCs decide that they need to hire some retainers, the Dungeon Master can simply ask them how many and what kinds they want, pass the game time it would take to find them, and announce that they've been hired.

Or, the PCs can go through the process of hiring them personally, and the players role-play the significant encounters and interviews.

When using the latter method, follow these steps:

1. The characters search for retainers. The DM should be ready to describe the local tavern or meeting place in town and to improvise other locations where the PCs will look for retainers.
2. The DM decides how many people will apply for the jobs based on the money and terms the PCs offer and the PCs' reputation as employers (if any). Most applicants will be "normal men" unsuited for adventure; for every few normal men, there will be one or more 1st or higher level NPCs. (Applicants will never be more than half the experience level of the PCs—unless the PCs are themselves 1st level, in which case some of the applicants will also be 1st level). It will not be immediately obvious which characters are normal men and which are higher level; these characters don't wear their experience levels on their sleeves!
3. The PCs conduct the interviews. They must specify the pay they offer, what is expected of the retainers, and what the expected length of employ is. The NPCs may ask detailed questions about the job and challenge the PCs about any rumors told about the PCs and their previous relationships with retainers. The PCs don't have to conduct a separate interview for every applicant; the DM will probably only want to role-play out the most interesting interviews. NPCs with interesting personalities, even those who are "normal men" characters and are trying to bluff their way into PC employ, are the ones who deserve to have their interviews played. Remember that some interviews will be with one NPC who is the leader of his own small band; in such a case, the PCs either hire the entire band or no member of the band.

1. The PCs can discuss the interviews and decide who they want to hire. They then talk to the NPCs again and make their formal offer. Roll on the "Retainer Reaction Table," modified by the offering PC's Charisma adjustment and any factors the DM thinks significant (such as especially high or low pay-rates). Most of the NPCs will accept; those who decline will do so because they want more money or had a bad reaction to the PCs during the interview.
2. For all the NPCs they hire, the PCs must buy all necessary equipment; the minimum-necessary equipment of armor and one or two weapons becomes the permanent property of the NPC and constitutes a "hiring bonus."
3. The DM must make up character sheets for all retainers. The PCs ought to work up "retainer sheets" to list all the details the PCs know about the retainers, including the retainers' names, character classes, races, list of weapons and equipment carried, and personality traits, plus any other information you wish to remember.

## Employer Charisma

Remember that the PCs' Charisma scores affect the number of retainers they can employ. See the Charisma Adjustment Table in Chapter 1 (page 10) for this number. Normally, you use the highest Charisma score among the PCs to determine the total number of retainers the PCs can hire. If the PCs feel they must have more retainers and the DM agrees, each PC should hire his own retainers based on his own Charisma score.

### Retainer Reaction Table

| 2d6  | Retainer            |
|------|---------------------|
| Roll | Reaction            |
| 2    | Refuse, insulted*   |
| 3-5  | Refuse              |
| 6-8  | Roll again          |
| 9-11 | Accept              |
| 12   | Accept, impressed** |

\* Insulted: Reactions of other potential retainers in the area are penalized by -1.

\*\* Impressed: Retainer's morale is high, for +1 bonus.

### Retainer Morale (Optional)

The morale of a retainer is a measure of the NPC's willingness to follow the PC in the face of danger. If the morale score is a high number (good morale), the retainer will stand fast, but if it is a low number (bad morale), the NPC may run away in a dangerous situation. The morale score is determined by the employing character's Charisma score; see the Charisma Adjustment Table in Chapter 1 (page 10) for this number. The DM may adjust retainers' morale scores due to PC actions, rewards, and so forth. Retainer morale should be checked after each adventure, and may be checked during adventures.

## Using Retainers

Remember that retainers are characters, not robots. A retainer doesn't know that he's an

NPC; in his own mind, he's the hero of his own story. He won't obey PCs' orders blindly or let himself be sacrificed to profit the PCs, and he won't be a happy employee if treated badly, threatened, or needlessly endangered.

## Retainers and Treasure

Retainers do not normally get a share of the treasure found on an adventure; regardless of the treasure recovered, they receive a set salary. See the "Dividing Treasure" guidelines from Chapter 16 for more on this.

When PCs hire retainers, they should clearly state whether or not the retainers receive any shares of treasures. If the PCs do not do so, the retainers will certainly ask about this in the course of the interview. If the PCs do pay the retainers a bonus from treasure, that may make the retainer more loyal. In other words, the well-treated retainer will face greater dangers without running away, and will obey the PCs' instructions more often.

## Retainers and Experience

When the DM calculates experience points at the end of an adventure, the total amount of experience points earned by the group is divided among the number of characters. A retainer gets one share of experience just as any player character does.

## Mercenaries

Mercenaries are hired soldiers who will fight and perform other typical military tasks. They do not normally go on dungeon adventures, and will only participate in certain wilderness adventures (fighting other armies, clearing monsters around a castle, defending the castle, etc.).

Players should be aware of the morale of their mercenaries; high death rates, low pay, and other poor treatment will cause them to revolt or desert their liege. Good treatment and exciting but not extraordinarily dangerous service will lead to greater loyalty, as will success on the battlefield.

Mercenaries are often hired to guard a castle or stronghold. The following costs only cover normal upkeep (feeding and supplying that soldier with normal gear). Mercenaries will already own their own weapons and armor, but a stronghold-owner will need to employ armors (100 gp/month) and smiths (25 gp/month) to keep the arms and armor in good condition.

For hazardous (wartime) duty, double all the costs shown (for mercenaries only!) on the Mercenaries Table; standard practice is to pay double normal pay-scales in times of war. The DM should decide what types of troops a character may employ, and their starting morale.

## Specialists

The characters may, at some point, want to hire NPCs with special training or skills in certain areas other than mere fighting. These people are known as specialists. Specialists are not retainers, and they will not go on adventures. However, a character may hire as many specialists as he can afford.

PCs find specialists by posting notices in towns and conducting interviews, as with retainers.

# Chapter 11: Nonplayer Characters

Such notices may be answered by none, one, or many persons, depending on the type of specialist wanted, the size of the local population, the reputation of the employer, and the amount of money or bonus offered. The DM may wish to establish guilds for various professions where certain types of specialists are commonly found.

The following list of specialists is not comprehensive; the DM may want to introduce many other types.

## Specialists Table

| Type of Employee        | Cost/Month (gp) |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Alchemist               | 1,000           |
| Animal Trainer          | 500             |
| Armorer                 | 100             |
| Engineer                | 750             |
| Magic-User              | 3,000+          |
| Sage                    | 2,000           |
| Seaman—                 |                 |
| Rower                   | 2               |
| Sailor                  | 10              |
| Navigator               | 150             |
| Captain                 | 250             |
| Spy                     | 500+*           |
| * Price is per mission. |                 |

Alchemist (1,000 gp/month): If given a formula or a sample, an alchemist may make a duplicate potion at half the normal time and cost. Alchemists may also conduct research into different types of potions at twice the cost and time required for a magic-user.

Animal Trainer (500 gp/month): Any PC can train a horse, mule, or dog; training any other animal or monster requires an animal trainer. Each animal trainer can handle up to six creatures. The first "trick" or command taught should require at least a month, and each additional command should take at least another two weeks. The lengths of time involved will vary with the intelligence of the animal, the complexity of the trick, and so forth. Training must be continuous or the animal becomes "untrainable."

Armorer (100 gp/month): For every 50 fighters hired, the PC must employ one armorer to maintain their weapons and equipment. Any armorer not employed in the maintenance of this gear may make nonmagical armor and weapons at the rate of one suit of armor, three shields, or five weapons per month. For every three assistants (one of which must be a smith) the armorer

may double this output, but a single armorer can only manage six assistants.

Engineer (750 gp/month): A PC needs to hire an engineer for the construction of castles and large structures. Dwarven engineers usually specialize in tunneling. One engineer must be hired for every 100,000 gp or less in construction costs.

Magic-User (3,000+ gp/month): See the character class description of magic-users, under "At Higher Experience Levels," for the description of the magist. A stronghold owner may wish to employ a magic-user on a more temporary basis to perform magical constructions, to set up magical traps, or to aid in a siege, thus explaining the listed temporary hiring fees.

Sage (2,000 gp/month): A sage is an advisor, capable of answering questions involving obscure knowledge. However, there is always a chance of failure in researching obscure questions. The DM must decide on extra costs of finding ancient books and time required. Sages are usually rare, and there might be few in an entire campaign.

Seaman (Rower, 2 gp/month; Sailor, 10 gp/month; Navigator, 150 gp/month; Captain, 250 gp/month): Rowers handle oars on galleys and longships. They fight as normal men, and only when the situation is desperate. Sailors are usually normal men who are capable of sailing vessels and fighting as light foot mercenaries when the craft is attacked. A navigator is skilled in piloting a ship on long ocean voyages. Any ship without a navigator becomes lost when losing sight of land. A captain, needed for most ships, has the skills of a sailor and knows coastal waters.

Spy (500+ gp/mission): A spy (usually a thief) may be hired to spy on a group the character wants more information about. The spy may either be an outsider who attempts to join the group or a member of the group who is bribed to become a spy. The DM must decide on the length of the mission, chance of success, and so forth, based on the information wanted, precautions against such spying, and the amount paid. There may be a chance that the spy will betray the character; the spy's loyalty is known only to the DM.

## General Skills

If you're using the optional general skills rules from Chapter 5, each specialist character will possess the skill that corresponds to his profession, as shown in the following.

## Specialists and General Skills Table

| Type of Specialist | Skills                             |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Specialist         | Acquired                           |
| Alchemist          | Alchemy                            |
| Animal Trainer     | Animal Training                    |
| Armorer            | Craft: Smithing                    |
| Engineer           | Engineering                        |
| Sage               |                                    |
| Seaman—            |                                    |
| Rower              | Profession: Seamanship             |
| Sailor             | Profession: Seamanship             |
| Captain            | Leadership, Profession: Seamanship |
| Navigator          | Navigation, Profession: Seamanship |
| Spy                | **                                 |

\* A sage will have a high Intelligence score; most of his skills will be knowledges and sciences. Since no character can have all the knowledge and science skills, each sage will be different, specializing in a different set of subjects.

\*\* No specific skills are required for a character to be a spy, but most spies have one or more of the following: Acting, Alertness, Disguise, Lip Reading, Stealth, Thief abilities.

## Stronghold Retainers and Staff

In Chapter 2, we discussed how characters reaching Name level and building their strongholds often attract retainers who serve in those strongholds. We deal with that subject in the next chapter, "Strongholds and Dominions."

In addition to retainers, a stronghold usually has a staff to maintain it. Although members of a stronghold's staff are NPCs employed by the player character, we also deal with them in the next chapter.

# Chapter 12: Strongholds and Dominions

![Decorative graphic element]()![](_page_133_Picture_1.jpeg)

Any character of any level can build himself a home—if he has the money to do so. Until he is sufficiently experienced and well known, he cannot build himself a stronghold—a fortification that allows the PC to assert his authority over the surrounding countryside.

## Dealing With the Authorities

When the character reaches Name level (9th level for most classes, 8th for halflings), we normally assume that he has sufficient experience and reputation that the region's rulers (kings, princes, etc.) approve of him becoming a stronghold ruler, or are cautious or respectful enough of him that they prefer not to oppose him on this matter. The following guidelines describe how characters go about becoming stronghold rulers.

### Clerics

When a cleric of 9th level or greater decides to construct a stronghold, consider the cleric's personality and history: Decide whether the player has done a good job at playing the character properly. If the cleric has ever been punished by his clerical order or by his Immortal patron, because of severe alignment changes, the cleric's order will not become involved in the construction of the stronghold.

On the other hand, if the player has done a very good job at all times of adhering to his alignment guidelines and helping his clerical order, the order will pay for *half* the cost of the entire stronghold!

If (as most commonly occurs) the situation is somewhere in between these extremes, the order will pay for up to 50% of the stronghold's cost. The DM decides how much the order will pay.

### Demihumans

When a dwarf, elf, or halfling character builds a stronghold (within the conditions given in each class description), the character's family will help to find a location. Then, if the character does not have the money to build the stronghold, the family will loan up to 50% of the cost to the character. If the character's Clan has a smaller stronghold than the new one, the Clan will move in. Otherwise, they still support the new stronghold by transferring up to 40% of their Clan to the new location.

If the character's stronghold is ever threatened by enemies, the whole Clan may come to the aid of the stronghold and may (if the threat is serious enough) bring other Clans. Even whole armies of monsters often hesitate at the thought of starting a major war against an organized demihuman Clan stronghold.

The political leader of a Clan is called the Clanmaster; the spiritual leader is the Keeper of the Relic. A player character does not normally gain any of these titles; they require great amounts of work and time, leaving none for adventuring. The highest rank normally achieved by a PC demihuman is that of Clanholder. A Clanholder serves the Clan, and may indeed own the structure of the Clan stronghold, but he does not control the Clan members.

The demihuman races care little for human

politics, and Clanmasters and Keepers do not seek human dominion titles. A PC Clanholder, however, may seek and achieve a title (baron, count, etc.) by representing the Clan in its dealings with humans. Permission must first be obtained from the Clanmaster and Keeper, but this is a common practice (especially if the PC owns the stronghold).

### Druids

Druids do not build strongholds, employ mercenaries, or hire civilian employees. However, druids do establish the same sort of authority over their surroundings that other Name level characters do. Local rulers ignore the presence of druids, pretending they don't exist, and druids normally confine their demonstrations of authority to people who abuse and wantonly destroy the forests protected by the druid.

### Fighters

When a fighter of 9th level or higher decides to build a stronghold, it is assumed that rumors of the character's great skill soon reach the ruler of the province or nation. To help gain the good will of the powerful character and his friends, the ruler will probably award some official title to the fighter. This award is usually that of baronial status; the PC is now entitled to call himself a baron (or baroness, with female characters). In such a case, the following events take place:

- Before construction starts, or while the stronghold is being built, the fighter is summoned to the ruler's stronghold and is officially proclaimed a baron or baroness.
- A scroll of rulership is drawn up, signed by the ruler and the character, and is given to the fighter as proof of the ruler's approval and support.
- The fighter returns to his territory and rules that territory. In times of war, the fighter must lend military aid to his ruler; if the fighter's territory is being invaded, the ruler will supply the fighter with military aid, if the fighter indicates that he needs it.

Alternatively, the DM might have established steps the fighter must undertake to be awarded a grant of nobility in the campaign. He might, for instance, have to serve the nation's ruler as a general to demonstrate his ability and loyalty, quell a number of military revolts or bouts of civil unrest, or receive the approval of a simple majority of the nation's other nobles, etc. If he fails to achieve these ends, the fighter cannot own a stronghold.

### Magic-Users

When a magic-user reaches 9th level or greater and builds a tower, the local ruler normally issues a proclamation; this proclamation makes it clear that the ruler's subjects are not to interfere with the magic-user or the tower. The magic-user does not have to seek permission or win approval of the local authorities; high level magic-users are notoriously independent and rulers seldom dare to make enemies of them.

If the magic-user's tower is ever attacked, despite the proclamation, the ruler will usually send assistance. However, if the attacker is another

magic-user, the ruler will not interfere; rulers rarely, if ever, meddle in the affairs of wizards.

### Mystics

When a mystic reaches 9th level, he may decide to build a stronghold called a *cloister*. If the mystic has had a good and noble adventuring career, the Grand Abbot of the mystic's current cloister will help the mystic build the new cloister. The Grand Abbot will pay up to 100% of the construction costs of a modest cloister. The new cloister remains a branch of the old cloister until the mystic reaches 13th level, at which time it can become an independent cloister.

Mystics do not rule lands. A cloister's mystics and mystics-in-training may farm the surrounding lands to support themselves, and may keep the region clear of dangerous monsters. But they never assert authority over nearby communities, nor are they required to send troops to local rulers.

Cloisters exist to spread the scholastic knowledge and discipline of the mystics' profession; though a cloister in a dangerous area may be built like any castle, it behaves like a school, not a ruler's fortress. For these reasons, regional rulers do not normally become involved with mystics and their cloisters.

### Thieves

When a thief reaches 9th level or greater, to build or buy a hideout, he must seek the approval of the Thieves' Guild. If another Guild is operating in the area, permission may be denied. However, if the character chooses an area not already controlled, the Thieves' Guild will help by recognizing the character's hideout as an official branch of the greater Guild and also by sending new apprentices to work for the character. If a rogue thieves' gang starts pilfering in the character's area without permission, the character can ask for and will probably receive Guild support in stopping such actions.

Members of the Thieves' Guild will normally be willing to tell a new master thief where he can start a new branch of the Guild. Most villages and small towns should not have hideouts, and larger communities may have one branch for every 1,000 normal nonadventuring residents.

Note that thieves are not often liked by townspeople or rulers, but the Guild is an accepted fact of life. Many powerful adventurers find thieves very useful during their adventures, and thus they support the Guild indirectly. Rulers are too wise to incur the wrath of player and nonplayer characters by harassing or destroying the large Thieves' Guild network.

### Independent Strongholds

If a character has been denied permission to build a stronghold (owing to failure to meet his rulers' requirements), he has a couple of options.

#### Biding His Time

The character can decide to wait and work toward gaining the acceptance of the ruler who has denied him the necessary permission. In the meantime, he may build himself a dwelling but cannot surround it with defensive walls and cannot have more than 50 mercenary employees.

# Chapter 12: Strongholds and Dominions

![Decorative floral border]()![](_page_134_Picture_1.jpeg)

![Decorative floral border]()![](_page_134_Picture_2.jpeg)

If he tries building a walled structure or employing a larger force of troops, he will make an enemy of the region's overall ruler, who will see him as an immediate threat to the throne. The ruler may decide to march troops against the PC, or to send a series of warnings before attacking, or to take more subtle steps to curb the PC's ambitions, as the DM chooses.

## Setting the Wilderness

The character might instead decide to take all his worldly goods out to an area considered true wilderness: No human or demihuman ruler lays claim to this land. There, he can build his stronghold and be its ruler.

In doing this, the PC is declaring his independence from his former ruler and establishing his own little nation. This could anger his former ruler; or, that ruler might approve and hope that the PC will be a success so that the ruler can later make treaties of allegiance with him.

The PC can choose his own title of rulership. If other dominions are near the newly founded domain, however, their rulers may react unfavorably to the "upstart," depending on the title assumed.

The Ruler Reactions Table gives a percentage chance of a reaction. Roll 1% for each NPC ruler of a domain near the newly founded territory.

If the roll indicates a reaction, the ruler will, at the very least, send spies and agents to gather information about the PC's domain. A reaction roll may be used to help determine further actions. A friendly ruler may send ambassadors, seeking alliance or friendship. An unfriendly ruler may send hired bandits or even an army. The exact actions must be decided by the DM, based on the nature of the campaign and further actions by the player character involved.

Remember, too, that an area might be considered wilderness because it is considered the property of some monster (such as an orcish culture, or a very territorial dragon); the PC could make himself permanent enemies by moving into territory that is claimed by some monster.

## Titles

A fighter who follows the normal procedure for becoming a stronghold ruler typically becomes a baron. This section details other titles of nobility in the game—titles the character can aspire to and titles of nobles the character will be dealing with.

In your own campaign, you may not wish to limit the acquisition of standard noble titles to fighters alone. A thief posing as a fighter might follow the fighter's procedures (though he'll probably have a secret Thieves' Guild headquarters in his stronghold), for example.

## Noble Titles

The ruler of a domain is called a *noble*, a member of the *nobility*. Nobles normally gain their titles by grant from a member of the royalty (see below), or possibly from some other sovereign (independent) ruler.

If the PC has a domain within the structure of an existing realm, then the PC's title is based on the following. Both masculine and feminine terms are given (feminine in parentheses). All titles are cumulative; for example, a king could be a duke, marquis, count, viscount, and baron.

A ruler who loses or leaves a domain may keep his or her title gained through rulership, regardless of current status, assets, etc.

A baron (baroness) rules a domain of at least one stronghold and the population needed to support it. The domain is called a barony. A baron may build additional strongholds within his domain, and the character may appoint seneschals to rule them.

A viscount (viscountess) rules one or more baronies, at least one of them through a baron. The greater domain has no special name. A viscount may also be a baron and thus directly rule a barony, or may choose not to keep that duty, as desired. A viscount can become a count only by adding a domain by conquest; other methods of adding domains do not change his title. A viscount may appoint seneschals.

A count (countess) is a viscount who adds a domain by conquest and rules at least three lesser dominions. The greater domain is called a county. A count can only become a marquis by adding another domain by conquest. A count may appoint barons and seneschals.

A marquis (marquise) is a count who has added one or more dominions by conquest (in addition to the ones necessary to become a count). If other dominions are added by any method, the title of duke can be gained. A marquis may appoint barons and seneschals.

A duke (duchess) is a marquis who has added one or more dominions by any method. Further additions do not alter this title. The greater domain is called a duchy. A duke may appoint seneschals, barons, viscounts, counts, and marquises, as long as the domain requirement for each is met.

## Royal Titles

The term *royalty* is reserved for kings (or higher rulers) and their families. Any royal ruler may, if desired, reserve the right to bestow noble titles. The following definitions are for D&D® game purposes, and do not precisely match the historical titles of the same names.

An archduke is a duke who is a relative of a

king or emperor, and who rules a domain in the kingdom or empire. The domain is called a grand duchy. This title can also be given by an emperor to an independent duke who joins the empire, though this is very rare.

A prince (or princess) is a child of a king or emperor, whether by birth, marriage, or adoption. A prince is usually a baron, but he need not be a domain ruler unless desired. A prince cannot grant other titles unless a domain is ruled, and the limits of the domain rank apply. For example, a baron prince can only appoint seneschals. The domain of a prince is called a principality.

A *crown prince* is a prince who will inherit a kingdom when the current king dies. An *imperial prince* is a prince who will inherit an empire when the emperor dies.

A king (or queen) is a ruler of a large greater domain, a kingdom. The lesser dominions within it are ruled by archdukes, dukes, or other rulers.

An emperor (or empress) is a ruler of a group of independent dominions, each ruled by a king, queen, archduke, duke, or lesser ruler. The greater domain is called an empire.

For kingdoms and empires, accurate domain details cannot be given; the types vary widely. If desired, a group of duchies may make up a principality that can be part of a kingdom, and all of them collectively can be part of an empire.

## Forms of Address

The following terms are used when speaking to any ruler in formal or social settings:

Baron, Viscount, Count, or Marquis: "Your Lordship/Your Ladieship"

Duke or Archduke: "Your Grace"

Prince: "Your Highness"

Crown Prince: "Your Royal Highness"

Imperial Prince/Princess: "Your Imperial Highness"

King/Queen: "Your Majesty"

Emperor/Empress: "Your Imperial Majesty"

Other titles are often used in addressing other important persons. For example, a knight is always "Sir" or "Madam" unless "Lord" or "Lady" applies and is then used instead. You may add other titles as desired.

A royal person (archduke or higher) usually uses the term "we" instead of "I" in formal speech; as royalty and as a high-ranking ruler, the "we" pronoun represents both the ruler and his dominion.

## The Construction Process

Once a PC has been granted permission to build a stronghold (or, in the case of magicians, simply decided to build the stronghold), he must first clear the local area of monsters. The "local area" constitutes one map hex, or an 8-mile by 8-mile area. The character enters the area with a force of men and either fights or negotiates with any monsters in the area.

An area is considered clear when all significant monsters in the area have been killed, driven out, or persuaded (through bribery, threats, persuasion, or mutual-defense agreements) to leave

## Chapter 12: Strongholds and Dominions

the PC's subjects alone. Note: Normal local wildlife does not constitute "monsters" for this purpose. The PC will have to clean out any man-killer animals, but does not have to destroy every normal animal in the region, even if these animals may be dangerous when menaced.

When the area is clear, the player draws a complete map of the stronghold he wants to build, using the details from the Fortifications Table. After the DM reviews and approves the plans (sometimes suggesting changes), the PC must find and hire an engineer, and, if the PC has the money to build his new home, the construction begins.

### Stronghold Plans

Most characters build strongholds that are medieval-style castles: a series of small buildings surrounded by a large stone wall. The whole complex is built so that the builders may add extra sets of walls, and may build additional structures within the innermost wall. Some of the elements normally found in a castle are the *keep*, a strong defensive building where the castle's defenders may retire if the walls are breached; *barracks* to house hired fighters; a *manor*, the normal home for the character, his family and servants; and simple *wall defenses*, such as a small tower plus gatehouse. A full castle complex can easily cost over 250,000 gp!

When drawing stronghold plans, the designer needs to allow for thickness of walls on his drawing. A castle's outside walls are about 10' thick, tower and gatehouse walls are about 5' thick, and stone house walls are about 1'-2' thick.

### Costs and Time

#### Costs

The Fortifications Table gives you the prices and characteristics of the "building-blocks" that are put together to make a stronghold.

The costs for typical structures are average for heavy construction taking place well away from heavily-settled areas. Most PCs are permitted to build their strongholds in unsettled, unruly lands; wizards, however, build where they choose. The costs shown include the costs for paying, feeding and sheltering the laborers who build the stronghold, but don't include the cost of engineers hired to oversee the site. The DM may round off costs to the nearest convenient figure to make record keeping simple.

**Important Note:** These costs can be used for structures other than strongholds. For example, a 5th level fighter might want to spend some of his hard-won treasure on a town house; he can use the Fortifications Table to choose and buy the type of dwelling he wants.

The DM may adjust the amounts for special circumstances; a nearby dwarven mining town might supply plenty of stonework at lower costs or supplies might have to be carted in for greater costs. More significantly, constructions in settled areas (i.e., constructions in areas already ruled and heavily settled, and in the vicinity of a town or larger community) cost much less to build. In settled areas, stone constructions cost about 40% of the prices listed; wooden constructions in settled areas cost about 20% of the prices listed.

#### Construction Time

The time required for construction is one game day for every 500 gp spent. This assumes the land has already been cleared and prepared and all the materials are on hand. For every 100,000 gp (or less) in costs, one engineer must be hired.

#### Notes on the Table

**Construction Detail:** Most of these terms are self-explanatory, but you can look at the "Description" column (far right) for details if the term is unfamiliar.

**Cost (gp):** This is the detail's cost in gold pieces. Remember that this is the cost for rural construction; in heavily-settled areas, stone construction is 40% of the amount quoted, and wood construction is 20%. However, heavily-settled areas already have rulers who normally won't allow PCs to build full castle complexes; PCs are normally limited to buying smaller homes with limited defenses.

**AC:** Two armor classes are given; the left-hand armor class is effective vs. missile fire, and the right-hand armor class serves to protect vs. melee attacks. Therefore, the gatehouse (-4/6) is armor class -4 vs. ballistas, catapults and the like, but is only armor class 6 against battering rams.

**hp:** Hit points; remember that an ordinary sword or fist won't serve to knock construction down. Consult the *Siege Machine Weapons Table* in Chapter 9 for effective weapon damage against construction.

**BR + (War Machine):** This is the construction detail's bonus to the BR rating of a military force within it. When using the War Machine mass combat rules, the BR bonuses apply only to the defending force, and only if that force remains within the fortifications. Note that these bonuses replace the standard + 50 bonus for a fortification (see *Siege Machine* for details).

**Description:** This column gives additional details about the construction element, including dimensions.

#### Notes on Construction Details

**Arrow Slot:** This is a defensive window that may be built into towers, gatehouses, keeps, stone or wood buildings, even dungeon corridors. An archer firing through it gets its defensive bonuses; he has only a 60° field of fire out from the window.

**Barbican:** The standard entryway into a castle. Its walls are stone, 30" (i.e., 2 1/2") thick.

**Battlement:** These go on top of stronghold walls. The AC is for the battlement itself (when it is being attacked by artillery, for example); it does not apply to the defenders who stand behind the battlements, but DMs may use the optional rules for cover to give defenders an AC bonus (see Chapter 8).

**Building, Stone:** This is a standard dwelling, two stories tall made of stone. The price includes interior walls, doors, stairs, floors and roof of normal wood; the exterior walls are stone 1' thick. The exterior walls may be arranged as the designer wishes: 30" x 40" is most practical and most common for dwellings, while 20" x 60" is very practical for workshops, bunkhouses and dormitories. The interior walls and doors may be arranged as the builder desires.

A stronghold designer can place two or more

such buildings together and consider them one continuous building; if a PC needs to build a large manor, this is one way to do it. When two stone buildings are placed together in this fashion, their BR+ bonuses do not combine.

**Building, Wood:** This building is of the same dimensions as the stone building above, and follows the same rules for layout and combining buildings together to form one building. A wood building can only be combined with another wood building; if placed it next to a stone building, the two are considered separate structures.

**Door, Exterior (Iron or Stone):** Such a door is normally placed on the entrances to keeps and stone buildings in order to make them more defensible.

**Door, Interior (wood, reinforced, iron/stone, secret):** Keeps, stone buildings and wood buildings come with interior and exterior wooden doors. These doors can be upgraded to reinforced, iron or stone doors by paying the appropriate amounts; not all doors in a dwelling have to be reinforced. Other types of construction (such as gatehouses and dungeon rooms) do not come with interior doors, which have to be added at full costs.

**Drawbridge:** This is the standard wooden platform raised and lowered by a crank device.

**Dungeon Corridors:** These are the costs for ordinary construction of dungeons. You can also use the cost listed for dungeon corridors to build secret passageways through castle walls.

**Floor, Improved (fine wood, flagstone, tile):** This is a finishing detail; it has no effect on the stronghold's defensiveness, but improved floors make the building look nicer, a good tactic for impressing visitors, demonstrating one's personal financial worth, etc.

**Gate, Wooden:** This is the standard entryway through wooden walls; stone walls normally take a gatehouse or full barbarian. The wooden gate consists of two large wooden doors with wooden reinforcing bars that enable the defenders to lock attackers out.

**Gatehouse:** This is the basic entryway through stone walls. It consists of a building with a passageway through it; the outside face of the passageway is barred by a portcullis, while the interior face of the passageway is guarded by a wooden gate. Add a drawbridge on the outside and two towers flanking the gatehouse, and the gatehouse is a barbarian instead.

**Keep, Square:** This is the basic ingredient of the castle. A heavy stone building that is the castle's last refuge when the walls are breached. A keep is massive: 60' on each side by 80' high. In a small castle, the keep is also the home of the family; in a large castle complex, it may be used principally for storage and possibly for housing troops when an area is attacked.

**Moat, Unfilled or Filled:** This is a defensive ditch; some are just earthen ditches that make it difficult for invaders to get to the walls, while others are filled with water or mud to increase the difficulty.

**Roof, Improved:** These, like improved floors, are cosmetic improvements designed to demonstrate the builder's wealth. However, tile roofs do not burn, which gives them a defensive benefit against burning pitch during a siege.

**Shifting Wall:** This is the sort of feature tricky builders use to provide for quick getaways, to

\* This price includes and assumes roofs, interior walls, doors and stairs of standard wood construction (15 points of damage to make a hole).

\*\* These prices include digging and mining down to 50'. For levels below 50', follow these guidelines: Double the listed prices for every additional 50' maximum depth up to a maximum of 5' x listed cost.

† These hit points can be divided into the components of this fortification.

‡ These, plus internal walls and modest furnishings, can be part of the building design by adding 25% to the cost of the basic structure; each type of item adds 25% (thus a stone building that comes with reinforced doors, tile floors, a roof of fine wood, stone stairs, shutters over all the windows, and decent furniture would cost 7,500 gp instead of 3,000).

trap dungeons, or to confuse invaders.

*Shutters (window):* Except in very temperate climates, all exterior windows on buildings that are normally occupied will need shutters to keep the wind and foul weather out.

*Stairs, Improved (fine wood or stone):* This is a cosmetic improvement, as with improved floors.

*Tower (Bastion, Round I, Round II):* This is a defensive tower normally attached to a wall. It is not the same as a wizard's tower, which is normally built along the lines of a stone keep.

*Trap Door:* This is a standard villain's trick; villains often put trap doors immediately in front of their thrones, so that they can deposit visiting characters in the dungeons without having to stand up. The cost of a trap door includes

the cost of a single trigger attached where and how the builder wants it. A trap door is 12 square feet in size (normally 3' x 4') and costs twice as much as an ordinary interior door of the same material type (i.e., an iron trap door would cost 100 gp); for every additional 12 square feet, add that base cost again (thus a 6' x 8' iron trap door would cost 400 gp).

*Wall (Castle, Wood):* These are standard exterior walls surrounding strongholds and other fortifications. A builder can double the width of a stone wall by doubling its price, and the BR+ bonuses add together. Also, a builder can have several sets of walls, each one inside the next; these are called curtain walls, and their BR+ bonuses do add together.

*Window (Open or Barred):* These are just fin-

ished openings left in the sides of dwellings to let in air and light for the inhabitants.

Stronghold RetainersWhen a 9th level or higher level PC builds a stronghold, he often receives troops and retainers to staff the stronghold. The type and number he receives varies with his character class.

ClericsOnce a cleric constructs a stronghold approved of by his clerical order (see the description of the cleric character class in Chapter 2), 1d6 x 50 (50-300) loyal troops will come to help the cleric. All will be of the same alignment as the cleric. Most

![Decorative flourish]()![](_page_137_Picture_2.jpeg)

will be normal men, with fighter leaders of up to 3rd level. Unlike mercenaries, they require *no* pay and they never check morale (they have a morale score of 12). The exact composition (number of archers, cavalry, etc.) and weapons carried are left for the DM to decide.

In addition to troops, the cleric will attract other low level clerics to serve the order. As with stronghold construction, these will be sent by the cleric's original order—1d6, if the character has been well-played; none if the cleric has received or is in need of some alignment punishment. These clerics will be of 1st-3rd level, and of the same alignment as the cleric.

## Demihumans

When a demihuman builds a stronghold, his Clan will help him with it. If no stronghold existed for that Clan, the entire family (1d6 x 30 1st level NPCs of the same class) may move in to help with and defend the stronghold, at no cost to the character. They will often patrol the area, but will not normally clear the area of monsters; for this task, the PC must hire mercenaries. A demihuman may only hire mercenaries of the same race.

Good and fair treatment will usually attract more NPCs (possibly other Clans, as allies), but family squabbles do arise, often for very minor reasons. A feud may result in a temporary lack of Clan support, which can be restored by apologies, possibly a political wedding or two, and a large feast to soothe feelings. Any such feuds will be put aside immediately if any real threat arises from outside the stronghold—but often just as quickly resumed after the danger passes.

Note that the owner of a stronghold does *not* automatically become the Clan leader; if the PC wants to become the Clan leader, this should become a campaign goal and the DM should provide adventures that let the character pursue it.

## Druids

Druids do not build strongholds and do not therefore gain stronghold retainers.

## Fighters

Once a fighter has become a baron or baroness, up to 50 normal men and fighters of levels 1-3 will come to apply for jobs and training. These NPCs may be of any alignment. If hired, they do work for pay; they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries, as described in Chapter 11 under "Mercenaries." In other words, the newly-landed noble fighter will not have to look around too hard to find troops, but he does not get "free" ones like clerics and demihumans do.

## Magic-Users

When a magic-user builds his tower, up to six magic-users of levels 1-3 (and of any alignment) will come seeking training. Up to 12 normal men will also come, seeking to become magic-users. Their intelligence scores will usually be above average, but many will probably become discouraged and quit after 1d6 months.

## Mystics

A mystic who founds his own cloister will be joined by 1d2 x 10 1st level mystics and 1d6 x 30 normal men who want to become mystics. The PC mystic will have to set up a self-sustaining school—that is, the mystics-in-training work the fields or at crafts to earn money enough to feed and shelter them all.

There may be a steady rotation of trainees; every year, 80% of the previous year's trainees leave in frustration or are told they have no aptitude for the mystic's arts and 1d6 x 20 normal men will come in to replace them. A normal man in training typically takes two years of game time to become a 1st level mystic.

## Thieves

When a thief character builds a hideout, he will gain 2d6 1st level thief apprentices, sent by the Thieves' Guild. These may be of any alignment, and are usually (but not always) loyal. At least one will be a spy for the local Guild, sent to keep an eye on the character's progress. The DM should decide on the income gained by the character from the minor pilfering of his subordinates.

## Other Stronghold Retainers

That's all the personnel the new stronghold owner receives "automatically." If he wants any more employees—and he normally will—he will have to employ them from the "Mercenaries" and "Specialists" guidelines from Chapter 11.

## Stronghold Staff

Every stronghold is maintained through the work of many people—the "staff." A staff's size can vary widely, depending on the title of the ruler, the size of the stronghold, and so forth. The following details apply to an "average" human stronghold.

The staff is all the same race as the PC. Any mixed staff will eventually cause problems. The ruler may keep troops ("garrison" troops) in a stronghold, but again, problems (fighting among themselves, taking orders) will arise if they are of a different race.

## Retainers and Servitors

The ruler is directly served by *stronghold retainers* and *servitors*.

You're familiar already with the idea of retainers; some stronghold retainers, however, aren't so much paid specialists as unusually loyal and well-regarded employees or noble-born subordinates working with the PC because they admire the PC. Stronghold retainers are never relegated to menial tasks.

A servitor is a particularly loyal servant or craftsman, often gaining the job through inheritance. The many types of common servitors include armorer, barber, carpenter, cellarman (wine steward), cook, dairyman, falconer, forster, gardener, grooms, kennelman, miller, portalmen, potter, poultryman, smith, stonemason, and weaver. When a servitor isn't listed on the Specialists Table from Chapter 11, he receives 5 gold pieces per month, plus room and board; if

the PC is particularly fond of a servitor, or the servitor is exceptionally skillful, the PC may wish to pay more for the servitor's services.

## Peasant Workers

Most of the normal work in a stronghold is done by peasants from the nearby community. These peasants work without pay; it is their duty to their ruler. Household servants, herdsmen, and others are trained, and given food, but are not provided shelter unless in times of war or siege.

The number of peasants available is determined by the population. As an average, each peasant family consists of 5 persons; 5% of the peasants are available to serve the ruler. For example, in a barony of 100 families (500 persons), the baron has 25 peasant servants. When visitors come, another 5% of the peasants can temporarily be used as servants, if needed. In large dominions, even the original 5% may not be needed to serve all at once, except for tournaments.

## Advisors and Officials

Most rulers have advisors to handle the many details of the dominion and stronghold, and to advise the ruler as needed. The most common advisors are the artillerist, castellan, chaplain, engineer, guard captain, herald, magist, chief magistrate, reeve, sage, seneschal, and steward.

Other officials may be needed for the proper handling of a stronghold or dominion, including a bailiff, chamberlain, equerry, magistrates, marshals, provosts, sheriffs, and wardens. When costs are not noted, the official is paid 5 gp/month.

An artillerist (750 gp/month) is a stronghold retainer whose specialty is siege weapons. This person, usually a 3rd-5th level fighter, also advises the ruler on some military details. The artillerist is a subordinate of the castellan.

A bailiff is a minor official in charge of one area of the stronghold (dungeon, walls, tower, etc.). He is the subordinate of the greater official who deals with that area. For example, the bailiff of the walls would answer to the castellan.

A castellan (2,000 gp/month) is an important stronghold retainer who is responsible for all military aspects of the stronghold, both offensive and defensive. The castellan is usually a fighter, level 5-9. He answers only to the ruler, or to the seneschal when the ruler is not present.

The chamberlain oversees the cleaning and food serving staff. He is subordinate to the chief steward.

The chaplain (500 gp/month) is the chief cleric of the stronghold, and possibly of the dominion. This title is added to the cleric's normal title. The relatively low cost is because 10% of all dominion income must be paid to the clerical order most preeminent in the area. If this title is not paid, the chaplain will not serve.

An engineer (750 gp/month) is a retainer experienced at construction—of a road, moat, building, wall, and so forth. If the PC wants to improve his dominion with such things, he must employ an engineer. The engineer reports to the seneschal.

An equerry is in charge of the care and feeding of horses and other animals; he supervises the

## Chapter 12: Strongholds and Dominions

grooms and stableboys. An equerry is the same as the bailiff of the stables. He is a subordinate of the chief steward.

The guard captain (4,000+ gp/month) commands all the ruler's personal guards, posts watches within the stronghold, and is responsible for the safety of the ruler—and the treasury. The guard captain is usually a 9th or higher level fighter. The guard captain is a subordinate of the castellan.

A herald (300-500 gp/month) is a retainer who knows the coats of arms, signs, symbols, and seals of most or all dominions near and far. The herald also makes announcements, both in courts and around the stronghold. The herald is also familiar with the requirements of honor and chivalry, and advises the ruler as needed. The herald is a subordinate of the chief steward.

A magist (3000+ gp/month) is a 9th or higher level magic-user who is responsible for all the magic needed in the stronghold, including its defense; as the magist gains more levels, he may demand salaries equal to 250 gp/level. The magist may have a tower elsewhere, dividing his time between his own home and his employer's, or may simply be a hired NPC (or PC) living permanently in his employer's stronghold. The magist is technically a subordinate of the PC, and answers to no one else, not even the seneschal.

The chief magistrate (2,000 gp/month) is a judge of the local law, acting for the ruler. The magistrate also learns the laws of the greater dominion (if any), and advises the ruler of them. The magistrate oversees the sheriffs and lesser magistrates. The chief magistrate is a direct subordinate of the ruling PC, and of the seneschal when the PC is away from the stronghold.

A normal magistrate travels among the towns and cities of a dominion, acting as judge for the peasants. He is the subordinate of the chief magistrate.

A marshal is an aging fighter hired to train troops and guards. He is a subordinate of the castellan.

A provost is a tax collector. He is a subordinate of the reeve.

A reeve (500 gp/month) is a bookkeeper, responsible for the records of taxes, tithes, gifts, and so forth.

A sage (2,000 gp/month) is a specialist in lore and obscure knowledge.

A seneschal (4,000 gp/month) is the most important person in a stronghold, except for the ruler. The seneschal is appointed by the ruler, and is responsible for anything with which the ruler does not choose to bother. The seneschal is the ruler when the ruler is not there; he answers only to the ruler.

A sheriff is a policeman, responsible for law enforcement, arrests and investigations. (Cases are brought before a magistrate for judging.) The sheriff is a subordinate of the chief magistrate.

The chief steward (1,000 gp/month) is responsible for all the day-to-day affairs of the stronghold, including food preparation, housekeeping, and so forth.

A warden is a person charged with the protection of some part of the dominion (game warden, town warden, etc.). He is a subordinate of the castellan.

### Special Positions

When a ruler is the liege of other rulers (count and higher), the lesser rulers may send their sons and daughters to the liege as servants and for training.

A squire is the son of a noble, who acts as a servant while being trained as a fighter. When the PC acquires the title of count, lesser rulers of his dominion offer him 1d6 squires. Squires become 1st level fighters after 6 months of training, and then gain at least 1 level of experience per year. A squire's training is finished when he reaches 5th level; the squire then returns home, and is usually replaced by another (beginner) squire. Knights usually have 1-3 squires assigned to them for training by the noble involved.

A lady-in-waiting is the daughter of a noble within the ruler's realm, acting as a servant but often actually in search of a husband. From 1-4 ladies-in-waiting will be sent to a PC count only if the PC is female or is married; the wife or grown daughter of a male PC ruler may be sent ladies-in-waiting. Ladies-in-waiting are trained and closely watched by the matron of the stronghold.

### After the Stronghold is Built

All cleared areas will remain free of monsters as long as they are patrolled. Patrols often range up to 24 miles from the stronghold, but jungles, swamps, and mountains require a garrison be built every 8 miles to keep the area clear. Additional area may be cleared and settled.

Settlers can be attracted to cleared areas if the ruler spends money on improvements (inns, mills, boatyards, etc.) and also advertises. These costs, and the number of settlers who move into the area, are the DM's decision. The settlers will pay *taxes* for support, protection, and so forth, based on the "Dominion Income" rules later in this chapter.

### Dominions

A piece of land that is owned and *ruled* is called a *dominion*. It may be of any size, and the ruler can be either a PC or an NPC. A dominion could be a small tower on an acre of land, or a mighty empire with thousands of people. All PC ruler strongholds, both human and demi-human, are called dominions.

Most dominions are part of larger territories; the ruler of the dominion typically swears an oath of service and fealty to a greater ruler. The smallest dominion is called a barony. Any larger area, containing two or more baronies, is very generally called a "greater dominion," and may have any of several names (county, duchy, kingdom, etc.).

### Basic Information

When a dominion is established, the DM must determine details of its size, location, population, and resources. When this is done, he can determine the dominion income. Changes in population, income, and so forth are checked once per month (of game time).

1. Size: New dominions usually cover 24 miles (1 map hex). Larger dominions are certainly possible, but a PC should start with a small one at best.

1. Location: Every map hex of land is one of three basic types:

"Civilized"—well-settled lands  
"Wilderness"—unsettled lands  
"Borderlands"—between the above

The DM should decide what type each hex of land is as needed.

When starting with a map of major terrain features, cities, and towns, the following guidelines may be used to determine which type each hex could be, based on terrain:

Clear, grassland, hills, river, or woods: Any type

Settled: Civilized or borderland

Mountain: Borderland or wilderness (or settled if it contains a dwarven stronghold)

Jungle or Swamp: Borderland or wilderness

Desert: Borderland or wilderness; however, an oasis may be any type

Ocean: Wilderness (surface) or any type (undersea)

Apply the following guidelines, based on the towns and cities placed (unless limited by terrain):

Every demihuman Clan is considered civilized, regardless of its population.

Any area that is 1-6 map hexes (8 miles per hex) from a city or large town (see Chapter 17, page 257) is civilized.

Any area that is 1-3 map hexes (8 miles per hex) from a civilized area is a borderland.

All other areas are wilderness.

These notes are guidelines, and the DM is *not* limited to the ranges given. An area may actually contain no cities or large towns at all, and still be considered "civilized."

1. Population: Peasant families are needed in every dominion, to work and settle the land. As an average, each peasant family has five productive members. The normal "starting number" of peasant families present varies by the type of map hex:

Civilized: 500-5,000 families per hex  
Borderland: 200-1,200 families per hex  
Wilderness: 10-100 families per hex

Each month, the population will grow or decrease by itself, at a rate determined by the number of families present:

| Population (Families) | Increase | Population (Families) | Increase   |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|------------|
| 1-100                 | +25%     | 301-400               | +10%       |
| 101-200               | +20%     | 401-500               | +5%        |
| 201-300               | +15%     | 500+                  | +1% to +5% |

Also, any hex may gain or lose 1-10 families per month for any of many reasons (accidents, weather, good or bad harvests, etc.).

# Chapter 12: Strongholds and Dominions

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_139_Picture_1.jpeg)

**4. Dominion Resources:** Every dominion has natural resources—either animal, mineral, or vegetable. The exact type can vary widely. Peasants use and provide resources, and the ruler gains tax income from them.

First, select or randomly determine (using 1d10) the amount of resources in the dominion. For dominions larger than 1 (24-mile) map hex, this may be applied to each hex.

Next, select or randomly determine (using 1d10) the type of resource. When selecting, consider the location of the dominion and its terrain; for example, a desert has very few vegetable resources.

## Dominion Administration

The ruler of a dominion sets all laws and tax rates, and controls as much of the lives of the peasants as desired. The ruler's liege normally leaves all matters in the hands of the local ruler, without interfering except in the most extreme cases. The greater ruler expects stability and very little else.

A dominion ruler is chief judge and lawmaker. A ruler holds various "courts" for formal occasions. In a court of law, criminal cases are judged. Courts of honor are held, in which awards of all types are given out. A court of welcome is held to honor visitors, especially nobles. Failure to properly honor a visiting noble is a direct insult; failure to honor a liege is treason.

Peaceful administration of the dominion is often left to a seneschal, a representative of the ruler. In time of war, the seneschal puts his abilities at the service of the castellan or other military commander designated by the ruler. A "ruling council" is made up of various advisors, each with his own area of authority.

## Dominion Income

Each dominion ruler receives income from three sources: standard income, resource income, and tax income.

**Standard income** is service equal to 10 gp per month per peasant family. This is *not* money; it is the value of services and materials from various

sources (used for paying taxes to one's liege, for holidays, and visiting nobles). Peasants work the ruler's fields, raise and tend animals, act as servants, build the roads, repair buildings, and so forth. This simplified game mechanic is used to represent many aspects of medieval life.

**Tax income** is normally 1 gold piece per month per peasant family, paid in cash. The exact tax rate is set by the ruler, but higher or lower taxes can cause various problems (see "Confidence Level").

**Resource income** varies by the type of resources, as follows:

| Animal:    | 2 gp per peasant family |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Vegetable: | 1 gp per peasant family |
| Mineral:   | 3 gp per peasant family |

When an existing dominion is obtained, income starts immediately. When a new dominion is created, all incomes begin after one month.

One other type of income applies to any ruler of more than one dominion—income from the lesser rulers who have sworn fealty to the PC, sometimes called "salt tax." Each ruler, including PCs, must pay 20% of all income to his or her liege (a ruler of a greater dominion).

### Dominion Income and XP

PC rulers gain experience points through rulership, by collecting resource and tax income from their peasant subjects. A PC or NPC ruler gains 1 experience point for each 1 gold piece of resource and tax income, but *none* for standard income or "salt tax" income. Experience points are gained at the end of each month. As DM, you may want to make the PC work for the experience points—by fighting monster, battles, worrying about drought, etc.

**Example:** A PC swears fealty to an NPC count, and receives an existing wilderness barony of one map hex. It has 200 peasant families, with 1 mineral and 1 animal resource. The player decides to use the standard tax rate. In the first month, the PC baron receives 3,200 gp worth of income: 2,000 gp of Standard income, 1,000 gp of Resource income, and 200 gp of Tax income. For that month, the PC gains 1,200 XP from dominion rule. However, if the PC does *nothing* in the game, he shouldn't receive less experience points.

During the second month, the population increases by 40 families (20% of 200), and 5 others come of age (by random roll), for a new population of 245 families. The total income for the second month is 3,920 gp: 2,450 gp of standard income; 1,225 gp resource income; 245 gp tax income. The experience point total for the second month is 1,470.

Modify this procedure as needed to maintain game balance. PCs should not gain vast amounts of XP by avoiding adventures! A PC should gain no more than 1 level of experience for 12-18 months of rulership (not counting XP from adventures).

PC overlords gain no XP for the payments from their lesser rulers (the salt tax). These payments are usually in the form of troops or merchandise, but may be cash. This income has already been credited to the local ruler (for XP purposes), and cannot be counted as XP for other rulers.

Note that the experience points earned by NPCs are always half the amount given to PCs, whether from adventures, rulership, or other activities. NPC rulers may thus rise in level (and power) as time passes, but not as fast as a PC.

Some Dungeon Masters may object to a PC receiving experience for passively remaining in a dominion. There are ways to discourage PC inactivity. The DM could increase the chance of a coup by 10% for every year the PC stays in his dominion (or 5% for every month). Alternately, the DM may apply double the normal chance for Unnatural Events per game month. Make sure the players know of these penalties in advance.

The following are clarifications for use in determining dominion income and XP gained for special situations.

**Rich Resources:** Any dominion hex that brings in more than 15,000 gp of resource income must have its own local ruler, lord of that hex alone. Otherwise, part of the resources are stolen by bandits, greedy peasants, nearby rulers, or other individuals who covet the wealth (d10 x 10%).

The wealthy hex and its ruler may be part of a greater dominion ruled by a PC; the PC gains 20% of the income generated thereby, though not the experience for it.

**Limit Family Skills:** Each family may work only one resource.

**Resource Maintenance:** All the resources in an area must be worked. Animal and vegetable resources cannot be ignored in favor of total exploitation of a mineral resource; such a method of rulership would bring rebellion. Each resource should be supported by at least 20% of the total number of families in the hex. Many peasant families prefer farming to mining and would strongly resent being forced into the mineral trade. If the peasant populace is forced to mine, apply a penalty against the next dominion confidence check of -1 per 10 families greater than 50% of the total population so forced.

### Record Keeping

The player should now have notes on the location, size, and population of the dominion, the number and type of resources, the three incomes, a total income per month, and total experience gained per month. The income is added to a dominion treasury, kept by the character. Note that the treasury is a combination of cash, merchandise, and so forth. Merchandise is assumed to be sold when possible, using trade routes. The value of the treasury is used to pay for troops, new construction, and other things. Only part of the treasury (20-50%) can be treated as cash during any one month, the rest is paid to the liege as tax. The PC may add cash to the treasury as desired.

The player should keep a record of each of the following dominion details:

- Dominion size and type of hex (each)
- Current population
- Number and type of resources
- Current treasury (both cash and total)

### Dominion Expenses

The overall cost of maintaining strongholds is assumed to have already been deducted for all incomes; no extra money need be spent for this by a PC ruler. However, other costs may occur

![Decorative header image]()![](_page_140_Picture_0.jpeg)

## Chapter 12: Strongholds and Dominions

that must be paid. All **dominion costs** are subtracted from the **dominion treasury at the end of each game month**.

First, if the **dominion** is part of a greater **dominion**, 20% of *all* income must be given to the higher ruler each month. Such "payments" are usually made in the form of military troops, and occasionally merchandise.

Second, 10% of *all* **dominion income** should be paid to the **theocracy** (the local clerical order which is most prevalent). Although this is not absolutely required, it is highly recommended. If this "tithe" (tenth) is not paid, no cleric will be permitted to perform any service in that **dominion** (including all forms of curing). If less is paid, certain services may be withheld; the **theocracy** has limited patience.

Other costs may include, but are not limited to, the following: advisors and other officials; entertaining visitors; holidays and feasts; troops; and tournaments.

### Visitors

Any ruler visiting a **stronghold** will expect to receive the services and comforts of home. This can become quite expensive, especially during visits from nobles.

This basic cost is in gold pieces per day of visit; the cost includes all costs for supporting the noble's retinue. When more than one noble visits at once, use the highest title applicable. For each titled visitor accompanying the higher ruler, add 50 gp to the cost.

The cost includes one feast per day, but does not include any gifts given to the visiting ruler (a common practice).

Noble Visitor Costs Table

| Title of Visitor | Cost (gp/day) |
|------------------|---------------|
| Baron            | 100           |
| Viscount         | 150           |
| Count            | 300           |
| Marquis          | 400           |
| Duke             | 600           |
| Archduke         | 700           |
| Prince           | *             |
| King             | 1,000         |
| Emperor          | 1,500         |

\* For a prince, cost is determined by the noble (dominion) title plus 100 gp; e.g., a visit from a count prince costs 400 gp per day.

Remind players to consider these costs when characters visit their own lesser dominions. A duke's week-long visit to a baron could put the poor baron deeply in debt.

Although peasants and other subjects of a **dominion** are loyal only to their immediate ruler, they will obey a visiting noble unless the orders are contrary to the local ruler's general instructions and laws.

### Holidays

Either a noble ruler or the **theocracy** may declare a holiday. The holiday affects all within the realm; for example, a king's holiday is nationwide. The cost of a holiday is deducted from the total income of the person declaring it (the clerical order's tithe, the overlord's 20%, etc.). If the holiday is declared by a count or lesser noble, the cost is 1 gold piece per peasant (5 gold pieces per peasant family). If declared by a duke or higher

### Confidence Checks

A Confidence check is made when:

1. A game year begins.
2. A pleasure or celebration expected by the populace is canceled or not conducted (see "Holidays," etc.).
3. A natural disaster occurs (see "Events").
4. An enemy military force enters **dominion territory**.
5. Some other situation arises that could affect most of the **dominion** (DM's option).

Do not roll dice to make a confidence check. Simply apply the results given below for the current confidence level (possibly modified for the situation).

1. 450-500+: The **dominion** is Ideal. Apply the following effects:
   1. All income is 10% greater than normal.
   2. Agents spying for other dominions may (75% chance for each) be secretly revealed to the ruler.
   3. If a random check indicates a disaster (see Events Table) during the coming year, there is a 25% chance that it will not occur.
   4. No changes to the confidence level of the **dominion** will reduce the level below 400 for the next check.
   5. Add 25 points to the confidence level for the next confidence check.
2. 400-449: The **dominion** is Thriving. Apply effects 1, 2, and 3 given for "A" (Ideal).
3. 350-399: The **dominion** is Prosperous. Apply effects 1 and 3 given for "A" (Ideal), and apply 2 with a 25% chance per agent.
4. 300-349: The **dominion** is Healthy. Apply effect 1 given for "A" (Ideal), and apply 2 with a 25% chance per agent.
5. 270-299: The **dominion** is Steady. Apply effect 2 given for "A" (Ideal), but with a 25% chance per agent.
6. 230-269: The **dominion** is Average. No special notes apply.
7. 200-229: The **dominion** is Unsteady. There is 1 chance in 6 that the confidence level will suddenly drop by 10%.
8. 150-199: The **dominion** is Defiant. Apply the following effects:
   1. Half of the peasants (2 1/2 times the number of families) form a peasant militia. (Use the War Machine mass combat system, from Chapter 9, as needed.) Special Note: If a **dominion** force is in

ruler, the cost is 2 gold pieces per peasant. The **theocracy** usually declares 2 holidays per year; the king (if any) usually declares one.

### Troops

One law of medieval society, perhaps the most important of all, is "support your liege." Failure to do so can mean loss of honor, loyalty, support,

any population center (town, village, etc.) equal to one-third of the number of peasants, the peasants in that area will not form a militia until the troops leave or attack.

1. Tax income is zero.
2. Standard income is half normal at best, or one-third normal in any area where a peasant militia exists.
3. Resource income is half normal at best, or one-third normal in any area where a peasant militia exists.
4. No demihuman Clan within or adjacent to the **dominion** becomes involved unless attacked or provoked.

1. 100-149: The **dominion** is Rebellious. Apply effects 1 and 2 as given for "H" (Defiant). Apply effect 3, but with one-third or one-quarter normal standard income. Apply effect 4, but with one-third or one-quarter normal resource income. In addition, apply the following effect:
   1. A - 5 penalty applies to the confidence level for each game month in which it remains below 200.
2. 50-99: The **dominion** is Belligerent. Apply effect 2 as given for "H" (Defiant); apply effect 3, but with one-quarter or *no* normal standard income. Apply effect 4, but with one-quarter or *no* normal resource income. Apply effect 6 as given for "I" (Rebellious), but with a -10 penalty. In addition, apply the following effects:
   1. All officials, trade caravans and parties of travelers will be attacked by bandits.
   2. Any of the **dominion's** forces moving within the **dominion** will be attacked by peasant militia, bandits, enemy agents, deserters, or hostile demihumans.
   3. All demihumans are hostile. Clans in or adjacent to the **dominion** forbid trespassing and commerce; all treaties and agreements are revoked. There is a 50% chance per demihuman Clan that the Clan will provide the peasants with military support.

1. 1-49: The **dominion** is Turbulent. Apply all effects given for "J" (above), but with double normal effects or 100% chance of all effects. In addition, apply the following effects:

1. All peasants are in open revolution; 95% of them join the peasant militia.
2. No income is obtained unless collected by force.
3. The confidence level of the **dominion** can never rise to 100 or above until the ruler is removed.

dominion, and even life.

Each greater **dominion** can expect military support (troops) from its lesser dominions, at their expense. No set numbers or types of troops are required, but 20% of the total income must be given to, or spent for, the higher ruler; troops are an acceptable way of spending this income.

If war comes, the overlord issues a general call

## Chapter 12: Strongholds and Dominions

to arms. Each lesser dominion must then contribute even more troops for the armies of the greater dominion, possibly led by the lesser ruler. In addition, a peasant army (troop class: "poor") is raised in times of war, to help defend the homeland. Normally, one-tenth of the total peasant population can "muster," joining the army. This number can be doubled if sorely needed, but the troop class then drops to "untrained." The only cost of a peasant army is a corresponding loss of income (of all three types). For example, if 20% of the peasants have mused, the total income will only be 80% of normal for that month.

### Dominion Confidence Level

A dominion's confidence level is a measure of the populace's satisfaction with their ruler. Ranging from 1 to 500, the confidence level is checked each game year, and as often as needed otherwise. The current confidence level should be noted, along with the notes on population, income, etc.

#### Determining the Confidence Level

The base confidence level of a dominion equals the total of 151-250 ( $d\% + 150$ ), plus the total of all 6 of the ruler's ability scores. This level is the same at the beginning of each new year, regardless of changes or temporary adjustments during the year.

(You may choose to create a more complex system, based on the various factors of dominion rule.)

#### Changing the Confidence Level

You may adjust the base number each month because of PC actions, events, and other factors as desired. A maximum bonus or penalty of 50 per month, or 10 per item is recommended. Many things could cause a change in confidence level, including (but not limited to) the following: tax rates, number and titles of visitors, number of tournaments held, number of advisors, officials and rulers, population growth or loss, weather, number of holidays, changes in nearby dominions, existence of bandits, wars, number and quality of magistrates and sheriffs,

number and quality of military forces, number of strongholds, events of all types, and relations with demihumans nearby.

### Changing Rulers

Though a ruler can appoint others to positions of authority (as given in each title description), taking away titles is a bit more difficult. A seneschal can be changed without trouble, but any change in noble rulers may cause a reaction based on the alignment of the deposed ruler. If the ruler was Chaotic, no reaction occurs among the ruled people. If the ruler was Neutral, there is a 50% chance of a reaction. If the ruler was Lawful, a removal reaction is automatic.

To find the exact reaction, roll 1d20, and compare the result to the dominion confidence level, using the following table.

**Changing Rulers Effects Table**

| Confidence | 1d20 Roll |      |       |       |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| Level      | 1-5       | 6-10 | 11-15 | 16-20 |
| 1-99       | V         | V    | V     | U     |
| 100-150    | V         | V    | U     | U     |
| 151-199    | V         | U    | U     | A     |
| 200-230    | U         | U    | A     | A     |
| 231-270    | U         | A    | A     | A     |
| 271-300    | A         | A    | A     | A     |
| 301-350    | A         | A    | A     | F     |
| 351-400    | A         | A    | F     | F     |
| 401-450    | A         | F    | F     | F     |
| 451-500    | F         | F    | F     | F     |

V: Violent Reaction from the peasants. Confidence level drops to 49—"Turbulent" (K)— if not already there. Peasant militia forces attack all strongholds; assassination attempts, sabotage, and other effects are possible (DM's choice).

U: Unfavorable reaction from the peasants. Subtract 20 points from the confidence level (minimum 0) for the next check only.

A: Acceptable reaction from the peasants; no change.

F: Favorable reaction from the peasants. Add 20 points to the confidence level for the next check only.

### Dominion Events

At the beginning of each game year, when a confidence check is made, the DM can also select or randomly determine events (both natural and unnatural) to occur in the coming year. A percentage chance is given for each event to determine randomly. The DM may modify chances as desired.

Each dominion should have 1d4 events per year. Random results should be modified for balance; four disasters in a single year could wipe out a dominion, which is usually unfair.

Space does not permit detailed descriptions of events; those included here will help to stimulate the DM's imagination.

#### Natural Events Table

All of the following depend on the terrain, location, and other details of the dominion.

In this chapter, we'll talk about coping with a wide variety of problems and strange situations that can crop up in a campaign.

## Ability Checks

During the play of the game, a player will eventually try something not explained in these rules. In most cases, the character's action could pertain to one of his ability scores. A character trying to walk along the top of a very narrow wall is using his Dexterity; a character trying to move the huge boulder blocking the corridor is using his Strength.

In such situations, have the character roll 1d20 against his pertinent ability score. If he rolls equal to or less than the score, he has successfully performed the task; if he rolls greater than his score, he has failed.

When the task looks exceptionally easy or difficult, the DM can modify the attempt by adding a bonus or penalty to the number the player rolls on the d20. This whole process is called the ability check.

See also the section on "General Skills" in Chapter 5; these rules provide alternative ways to resolve special situations.

## Aging

In the D&D® world, disease, blindness, and other afflictions can be easily cured by clerical spells. Furthermore, the *raise dead* and *raise dead fully* spells seem to bestow near-immortality—but this is not quite true.

Character aging should be a carefully restricted element of the game. When a character reaches the end of a long natural life span, magical means of prolonging or restoring life should have little or no effect. A *raise* spell should only restore the character for a brief period of time (1d10 days or whatever the DM chooses). The following ages are recommended as the maximum for character races:

| Human   | 100 | (95 + 2d12)   |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Halfing | 200 | (190 + 2d20)  |
| Dwarf   | 400 | (375 + d100)  |
| Elf     | 800 | (750 + 2d100) |

A *potion of longevity* does remove ten years of aging, but the DM may apply any restrictions as desired. For example:

1. The potion might only affect unnatural aging (such as that caused by haunts); or,
2. Each living creature might only be able to drink five such potions in a lifetime, all further uses having no effect; or,
3. Each use might have a chance of creating a reverse effect, aging the character 10 years.

A *wish* should be the only magic capable of extending a character's life to a great degree. As a guideline, it should have a maximum effect equal to that of a *potion of longevity*, but without restrictions.

Some characters will avoid the fate of aging by undertaking the path to Immortality and succeeding in that quest. Other characters who have lived long, exciting and fruitful lives will probably accept the final rest brought by death, particularly if their players are anxious to get on with new, vital characters.

## Alignment Changes

Sometimes a player forgets (or ignores) the alignment of his character, and plays the adventurer incorrectly. You should talk privately with the player about the problem, and encourage the proper play of alignment. Never do this during a game; deal with the problem in private.

If the problem continues after you have warned the player more than once, you may tell the player to change the alignment of the character to the alignment actually being played. *You* may also assess a penalty against the character at this time, such as the loss of one level of experience.

Remember, too, that *you* have not changed the character's alignment: The player has, by playing his character as a different alignment.

Sometimes players will change their characters' alignments for appropriate reasons. If a character is affected by a *helm of alignment changing* or other cursed treasure that affects alignment, then obviously the player had no choice. (Generally, the original alignment will return a period of time after the helm or the curse is removed.) Also, events in the life of a character might force the player to reevaluate the character's personality and play him differently. So long as he plays the new alignment well and consistently, there should be no problem.

If you penalize alignment changes, you should also reward good alignment play by awarding more experience or treasures.

## Anti-Magic Effects

Magic can sometimes be weakened or altered so that it is canceled or only partially functions. This phenomenon is called anti-magic (A-M). Anti-magic is stated as a percentage chance that magic will not work within a given area.

The first encounter with anti-magic for most PCs occurs when they confront a beholder, whose central eye projects an anti-magic ray.

This ray's A-M value is 100%; magic will not work within the ray.

Some very rare creatures (notably Immortals) possess partial or total anti-magic.

## Why A-M Exists

Anti-Magic results from differences between life forms native to different planes of existence. Magic native to the inner planes of existence (the Prime, Ethereal, and elemental planes) functions best when used on creatures and things native to those planes. Creatures from other planes are not made the same way.

All creatures native to the inner planes are made of components of the four Spheres of Power (Matter, Energy, Time, and Thought) and are all affected by the Sphere of Entropy. But creatures of the Astral and outer planes lack one or more of the four components, and may avoid most of the effects of Entropy as well.

## Magic Affected

When A-M is used as an attack form (such as the beholder's ray), it is powerful enough to cancel the effects of all forms of magic, including permanent items. The instant a magical item is moved out of the ray, it regains normal power.

Anti-magic radiated by a creature such as an Immortal is slightly different; it is sporadic (there is a percentage chance for it to affect each spell or item), and it only affects temporary magic.

Temporary magic includes all spells, potions, scrolls, wands, staves, and rods. All spell-like effects produced by permanent magical items (such as the *haste* effect that a *sword of speed* can produce) are also temporary effects, subject to dampening by anti-magic, but the magical items themselves are unharnessed.

If no percentage is given for the A-M effect, it is 100% and affects all magic within the area noted. Otherwise, each temporary magical item or effect must be individually checked for cancellation of its power as soon as it enters the A-M area. A-M is checked each round by rolling d100. A magic effect is canceled if the d100 result is equal to or less than the given A-M percentage. Once an effect is negated, it remains canceled for the entire encounter.

## A-M Duration

It is important to note that A-M is not a *dispel magic* effect. Canceled magic may return once it leaves the range of the A-M effect. Magic canceled by radiated A-M remains canceled for one turn after it leaves the A-M area.

The time during which a magical effect is negated *does* count as part of the duration of the spell or effect. Magical effects described as instantaneous (*fireball*, *lightning bolt*, etc.) are destroyed by the A-M and do not reappear later.

## Detailed Examples

### 1. Potions

An Immortal comes within A-M range of a potion of *flyng*. The potion is deactivated (by random roll) and becomes nonmagical flavored water. If consumed during this time, the water has no effect, and all benefits are forever lost. If not consumed, the liquid again becomes a standard potion *offlying* one turn after the Immortal departs.

### 2. Personal Spell Effects

A fighter with *plate mail* +3 and *shield* +3 drinks a *potion of polymorph self* while his allies cast *bless* and *haste* spells upon him. He turns himself into a giant, picks up a nearby club, and attacks an Immortal. As he attacks, he steps within range of the Immortal's A-M. The DM checks the A-M, rolling once for each of the fighter's magical effects.

By random roll, the *bless* and the *polymorph* are canceled, but the *bless* is not. The character instantly resumes normal form and slows to normal speed but still gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. He can no longer use the giant-sized club, but draws his *sword* +3 instead. The weapon, armor, and shield are not checked, since they are permanent magical items.

When the DM checks again at the start of the next round, the *bless* is negated also, so the bonuses no longer apply.

One turn after the Immortal leaves or the fighter moves out of range of the anti-magic, the fighter's *polymorph* and *haste* effects reappear. The fighter can continue to use the *polymorph* effect for 5-10 more turns (the potion effects

# Chapter 13: Dungeon Master Procedures

![Illustration showing a wizard casting a spell, resulting in a large explosion of fireballs and debris.]()![](_page_143_Picture_1.jpeg)

lasts 1d6 + 6 turns, minus one turn for the combat and one turn to recover from the A-M effect). The *haste* continues for one more turn (the spell effect lasts for three turns). One round after the *haste* and *polymorph* effects resume, the *bless* effect returns, and lasts for four more turns.

### 3. Area Spell Effects

A 25th level magic-user is standing 140' away from an evil Immortal surrounded by ten tough trolls (45 hit points each), and casts a *fireball* at them. Having heard that this Immortal has personal A-M effects, the magic-user aims the blast to explode 10' from the Immortal. Her player rolls 20d6 (the maximum) for a total of 91 points of blast damage. The DM checks the Immortal's A-M range and percent and notes that the blast effect of the *fireball* will be canceled when it reaches the A-M.

The *fireball* explodes outside of the A-M range and the blast expands to fill the usual 20-foot-radius sphere, but within 5' of the Immortal it is stopped as if blocked by an invisible shield. The Immortal isn't even singed, nor are two of the trolls who happen to be within 5' of it.

If the A-M fails to cancel the *fireball*, the Immortal and the trolls take damage from the blast. Each may make a saving throw vs. spells to take only half damage.

If the *fireball* were aimed to explode within 5' of the Immortal, and if the A-M then canceled it, the explosion would not occur at all. Because the spell is instantaneous in duration, the *fireball* will not reappear at a later time.

## Arguments & Complaints

If an argument starts during a game, stop the game for a moment. Listen to both sides, and make a decision. Then continue the game as soon as possible. Do *not* allow an argument to continue for long. Explain that everyone is trying to have fun, and that the argument can be settled *after* the game if necessary.

If a player complains about the way you are handling something in the game, try to listen to the objection. Be reasonable—he might be right! If you can fix the problem by changing a procedure, try to work out a reasonable compromise. For example, if a player says "You keep killing characters with poison!", you might try reducing the number of poison traps and monsters you have in your campaign.

Be careful not to change rules that could overbalance the game in favor of the characters. The game system is carefully balanced to provide fun for all while challenging the characters.

Some complaints may be caused by a player's greed. It should not be too easy to get treasure or experience; these things should be earned slowly, using the guidelines given. Beware of the "giveaway" (aka "Monty Haul") game! Your players may quickly become bored with easy riches, and their characters will easily overpower most monsters.

If you are not sure how to handle a situation, just tell this to the players. Everyone has to learn, and learning a game like this can be a slow process. Your players will understand if you explain that you made a mistake, and they might have a

sound and fair recommendation for ways you can handle the situation. When you admit your mistakes and try to correct them, you and your players will have a better game in the long run.

## Charm Person Spells

Whenever a magic-user or elf casts a *charm person* spell, the player will ask you for the effect. This spell will only affect certain creatures. The beginning player will try it on many different monsters, and learn by trial and error.

Generally, the creatures affected by a *charm person* spell are classified as "humanoid" in Chapter 14—those that are "normal" human, demihuman, giant-size humans, or human-like creatures that have some sort of society.

Once a victim fails the saving throw against the *charm*, the creature will remain charmed for at least 24 hours, and often longer. The victim may make a new saving throw to break the *charm* each time the controlling character places the *charmed* character in a dangerous situation, without himself being in that danger, or after a given duration. This duration is determined by the victim's intelligence and is stated on the Duration of Charm Table.

Humans, dwarves and halflings may have any intelligence score from 3 to 18. Elves always have an Intelligence score of 9 or better, and magicians normally have an Intelligence score of 13 or better. When randomly determining a human's intelligence, roll 3d6 for most humans, 2d6 + 6 for elves (treating any result of 8 as a 9), and 1d6 + 12 for magic-users.

| 18           | 8 hours    |
| 19           | 3 hours    |
| 20           | 1 hour     |
| 21+          | 1 turn     |

Some lycanthropes can be *charmed* when in human form, but this is nearly useless: Only werewolves and werboars are affected and the charm will automatically be broken when the creature assumes animal form!

## Climbing

Thieves (and *only* thieves) have the special ability to climb sheer surfaces. However, any character can try to climb more ordinary surfaces (a tree, a steep hill, a wall with easy handholds, etc.) many situations arise where characters want to do this.

Generally, any characters in metal armor will not be able to climb well. Characters in leather or no armor should be able to climb easily, with only a slight chance of falling. In situations where "normal" climbing might be attempted, first decide on a base chance for success. For example, if characters seek to spend the night in a tree with many overhanging branches, there might be an 18 in 20 chance of successful climbing by unarmored characters. Those in metal armor, such as chain mail, might find their chances slimmer (11 in 20) in climbing up top. Dexterity checks (roll Dexterity or less on 1d20) may allow an easy way for DMs to check chances of PCs falling from their perches. Whatever chances you decide to use, make a note of them so they may be applied in future games. Remember that falling characters take 1d6 points of damage for each 10' fallen.

## Clues

Beginning players often need help in learning to play. When running a game for beginners, the DM should encourage them by saying such things as "Do you want to search for secret doors?" or other suggestions. This should not be continued once the players have experience with the game, but such clues can be very helpful to beginners.

You may wish to allow some "automatic success" situations to encourage the players. Those who never find secret doors will soon stop looking for them.

When the players gain experience with the game, they may start asking questions like "Do we find any traces of passing creatures?" or "We don't know which way to go from here. Are there any clues?" You may offer descriptive information that players will have to determine what it means.

For example, "Some footprints lead off to the left, but you're not sure what made them." Such clues may help to steer the party in the right direction within a dungeon. You may insert clues as part of the room descriptions.

Clues should be given when the party is approaching a deadly area, especially on the first or second level of a dungeon. Clues such as awful smells or bones of earlier victims warn characters that there is extreme danger nearby; subjecting characters to such danger with no warning is not very fair.

Higher level characters are more accustomed to great dangers, and deeper dungeon levels may indeed contain sudden-death situations. Vague or misleading clues may be provided by treasure maps found or purchased, or by slight hard-to-find indications in the dungeon areas. In general, when the players become more experienced, the clues may become fewer and more subtle.

## Creating Characters

When a newly created character has all low scores (all scores under 9), the player should be allowed to discard it.

You should allow beginning players to use characters they like! It's hard to have fun playing when you are forced to use a poor character, with no score above 9 or two scores below 6; such characters should be discarded. (On the other hand, a player might want to play this character; if he does, let him.)

If a player wants a certain class of character but rolls abilities that strongly favor another class, you may allow him to switch the ability scores around. Just switch the highest score rolled for the character to the Prime Requisite ability appropriate to the class the player wants.

## Damage to Magical Items

Any item may be damaged by rough treatment. Armor and weapons, however, are made to withstand a great amount of punishment.

The DM should decide whether an item might be damaged, based on the item and the type of attack and then would make an item damage roll.

Some breath weapons (acid, fire, cold) should require such checks. If the user makes his saving throw against the breath weapon, magical bonuses can be applied to the item's roll.

Long falls (100' or more) should require checks. Pools of acid, rockslides, and other cases of extreme damage should require checks for items carried. A scroll normally need not be checked except against fire damage; you may also include water damage, if desired.

To check for damage to items, roll 1d4 or 1d6 (using 1d6 if the chance of damage is high). If the result is greater than the item's Strength (number of "plusses"), the item is damaged.

Items without plusses may be given ratings for this purpose. Consider:

any potion or scroll as a +1 item;

any wand or staff as a +2

and all permanent items (such as rods, rings, and miscellaneous items) as +3.

This roll may be modified; for example, if a

character is hit by a rockslide, Dexterity adjustments could be applied to the rolls. If a character tries to break something, Strength adjustments could be applied. No adjustment should be greater than +2. However, adjustments to the chance of survival can be any number of subtractions from the roll. A potion bottle dropped from a tabletop might require a check for breakage, but with a -2 adjustment (thus, only a roll of 4 indicates breakage).

If an item is damaged, it may either be partially damaged or completely destroyed. For items with magical bonuses, one or more points may be lost due to damage (DM's choice). Potions and scrolls should be completely destroyed by any severe damage.

## Demihuman Clan Relics

Each demihuman clan has a sacred item, called a "Relic," which is kept in the center of the clan stronghold. The Relic is tended by a Keeper and 2d4 aides. We describe the individual types of relics below.

The position of Keeper is hereditary; each Keeper passes the secret knowledge of the tending and use of the Relic to his or her son or daughter, *never* writing down any details, lest they be stolen. This secret knowledge includes details of constructing a special item, as given in each class description.

## Relic Powers

Each sacred item gives a *domination* power to its Keeper. It also continually radiates an aura, which has a "turn undead" effect similar to a cleric's. The Relic may, at unpredictable times (those best for the story being played), manifest the following additional spell-like abilities; this only occurs when the DM says they do, and the PCs can never predict these events.

*cure blindness*

*cure disease*

*neutralize poison*

*cure serious wounds*

*identify magical item*

### Domination

The Keeper of a Relic enjoys great prestige among the clan; the powers of life and death are literally in the Keeper's hands (much as a human cleric's). Thus, the Keeper is held in awe by the entire clan.

In game mechanics, this is a *domination* ability—the Keeper can give orders, and the clan members will obey them. The only clan member immune to this effect is the Clanmaster, the leader of the entire clan, who respects the Keeper's power but is not in awe of it, recognizing it as a service and a tool for the clan's survival.

The Keeper never abuses this power; it is always used for the best interests of the clan, not the Keeper. The Clanmaster is often consulted about important situations and orders, and kept advised about the current amount of power in the Relic (see "Spell-Like Powers," below).

If the rare situation occurs where the Keeper gives an order to an NPC Clan member and the Clanmaster counters it immediately, the recipient of the order is *confused* (simply unable to act or think clearly) until the situation is resolved. A

# Chapter 13: Dungeon Master Procedures

![Decorative header graphic]()![](_page_145_Picture_2.jpeg)

PC may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid this confusion.

Turn Undead

The Relic constantly radiates a magical force that has the same ability to turn undead as a 15th level cleric, at a base range of 360'.

In many ways, this effect is more powerful than the cleric ability, for even if the turning attempt fails (against nightshade or larger), it is automatically repeated in the following round. In addition, turned undead will probably not return (check morale, applying a -6 penalty).

Spell-Like Powers

The power for each of these effects comes directly from the Relic. That power is diminished when the Keeper uses the Relic's other spell-like powers.

The Relic's turn undead effect starts out with an initial range of 360'. Each use of a spell-like power reduces this range by 5'. When it reaches 0, the Relic can do nothing further; its turn undead power is negated and none of its spell-like powers work. When properly tended by the Keeper, the Relic's power returns at the rate of 5' range per day (but never faster).

*Cure blindness, cure disease, neutralize poison, cure serious wounds*: These effects are identical to the clerical spells of the same names, treated as if cast by a 15th level cleric.

*Identify magical item*: To use this power, the Keeper places a magical item by the Relic, leaves it there for 24 hours, and then touches the item. Knowledge about the item then magically appears in the Keeper's mind. The name of the item and number of "plusses" are revealed, but *not* the number of charges (if the object uses charges). *Cursed* items will, unfortunately, be identified as normal ones. As with the use of clerical spell effects, this reduces the Relic's turning range by 5'.

## The Dwarven Relic

A Forge of Power rests at the heart of every dwarven stronghold. Most Forges of Power consist of a pair of objects: a large crucible (objects placed within it are automatically heated to appropriate temperatures), and a large anvil (upon which metal objects are hammered and shaped). The Forge is used to create the fabulous *dwarven lens* and the extremely rare *oil of darkness* (described later).

A Forge may only be left unattended if an entire clan is destroyed. If any nonwarf finds and possesses a Forge, most dwarven clans that hear of it will offer to buy the Forge, for 100,000 gp or more (depending on the clan's resources). If the finder refuses to sell it, the clans may employ thieves to steal it, or may even assemble an army to retake it, as they consider the Forge to be the property of dwarves and dwarves alone.

However, if the finder sells it to dwarves for 50% of the amount offered (or less), the clan buying the Forge will award the title of honorary clan member to the person selling it unless he destroyed the clan that originally owned it.

## The Elven Relic

A Tree of Life stands at the center of every elven clan stronghold. It also may be used to create

the fabulous elven *lightship* and *oil of sunlight* described below.

This large, intelligent tree may be mistaken for a treant. It cannot be moved, nor can it move itself, except by an elven Treekeeper. It can only be left or found unattended if an entire clan is destroyed. Most elven strongholds will pay 20,000 gp or more for accurate information about the location of a living clanless Tree.

## The Halfing Relic

A Crucible of Blackflame rests at the heart of every halfing clan stronghold. Blackflame is like normal flame in reverse: It burns ashes and leaves whole items. The Crucible, a truncated pyramid-shaped wooden container, may be used (along with the Blackflame itself) to create the fabulous *web of shadows* and the extremely rare *oil of moonlight* described later.

A Crucible may only be left unattended if an entire halfing clan is destroyed. If any nonhalfing possesses a Crucible, most halfing clans hearing of it will offer to buy the Crucible for 10,000 gp or more, or 100,000 gp or more if it contains Blackflame (depending on the clan's resources). If the finder refuses to sell it, the clan may employ thieves to steal it, or may even assemble or hire an army to retake it, as they consider the Crucible to be the property of halfings and halfings alone.

However, if the finder sells it to halfings for 50% of the amount offered (or less), the clan buying the Crucible will award the title of honorary clan member to the person selling it if he did not destroy the clan that originally owned the crucible.

## Craft Use of the Relics

The rules that follow are for DM and NPC use only; no player character can participate in the construction of these famous, but incredibly rare items. You may place one or more of these in a campaign, but *very* few should exist, if at all. Each requires centuries of work to create, and should be treated with appropriate awe and respect by the demihuman clan involved.

### Dwarf

By using the Forge of Power, the Keeper, Clanmaster, and several dwarven blacksmiths (all of maximum level) can work together to construct a *dwarven lens*—a sheet of pure gold, gently hammered out to perfect paper-thin texture. This is a long task; it must be worked slowly and carefully, and requires centuries to complete (800-1,000 years). The completed *lens* is a 10' diameter disk, mounted in a ring of pure gemstone, and is used only to create *oil of darkness*.

The *lens* actually concentrates and distills darkness itself to form the *oil*, and can only create one ounce per year if left in complete darkness throughout the year; *any* light will spoil the entire batch.

*Oil of darkness*, in turn, is used to make *rock-ships*, famous but extremely rare magical dwarven rock boats, which can move through solid rock as easily as birds move in the air. One hundred ounces of *oil* are needed for each rockship; each rockship can carry a crew of 10 dwarves and it moves at the same rates as a war-galley.

The *lens* and *oil* cannot be created by any other means, including a *wish*.

Dwarven clans also can construct magical hammers, shields, armor, and other items typical to dwarves by using a Forge of Power. The cost and time for construction are left to the DM.

Elf

An elven Treekeeper, Clanmaster, and several aides (all maximum level) may use a Tree of Life to create the famous but extremely rare elven *lightboats*, in the following manner.

The Treekeeper draws one ounce of sap (at most) each month from the Tree of Life, distilling it to a single drop of golden liquid. Extreme care must be taken lest the Tree be harmed by the drawing of sap (which could seriously reduce or even negate its special powers). With the help of the Clanmaster and aides, the Tree's branches are guided so that a few leaves of perfect paper-smooth texture are grown each year. The distilled sap is mixed with the powdered leaf veins, creating *oil of sunlight*—the distilled essence of light itself. The process can only produce one ounce of *oil* per year.

Other perfect leaves are carefully pressed into the shape of the lightship hull, and enchantments (known only to the Treekeeper) are cast upon it. At the right moment of the year, the *oil* is spread on the specially prepared hull, and the final enchantments cast. If all goes well, the lightship is then complete, able to fly through the air at 360' per turn as long as it remains in sunlight (which propels it). One hundred ounces of *oil* are needed for each lightship; each lightship can carry ten elves.

The *oil* cannot be created by any other means, magical or otherwise, including a *wish*.

Elven clans also can construct magic bows, arrows, swords, and other items typical to elves by using a Tree of Life. Cost and time for construction is left to the DM's discretion.

### Halfing

A Crucible of Blackflame is a truncated pyramid made of rare wood, with a solid base, and a triangular hole in each side. The Blackflame inside a Crucible of Blackflame is exactly the reverse of a normal flame, black in color and emanating darkness and coolness, with flickering reverse "shadows" of light. The flame will burn anything normally not burnable, and will not harm combustible items (hence the wooden container). Blackflame can be used to light a torch without burning it, and inflicts cold damage in the same manner as a normal fire (but reversed). Blackflame will also restore ashes to their original form, but does not return an incinerated victim to life.

Using the Crucible and the Blackflame, the halfing Keeper of the Flame, Clanmaster, and several halfing sheriffs can work together to construct a *web of shadows*. Occasionally but very rarely, the odd shadows cast by a Blackflame have material existence for a short time; if caught and immediately placed in the Crucible, these wisps of material can be stored. When enough shadows have been caught (a procedure that takes over 200 years), the Keeper can draw power from the Crucible itself (using the ancient secrets) and weave the *web of shadows*, a 10' square net of gossamer strands. It cannot be seen

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_146_Picture_1.jpeg)

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_146_Picture_2.jpeg)

by any means (even magical) except in shadows or moonlight, and is carefully kept and stored by the Keeper.

The *web* is used for only one thing—collecting moonlight. When the Keeper and Clammaster hold the web for an entire night under the light of a full moon, chanting the ancient phrases known only to themselves, the moonlight is caught and distilled, forming a single drop of silvery liquid. This *oil of moonlight* is collected and stored in shadow, avoiding the light of day. A full ounce is required for any effect (gathered over 7-10 years), and may then be rubbed into a fabric (often to make a sail or kite). Any object thus treated gains the ability to fly at 360° per turn when in moonlight, which propels it.

Halfing clans also can construct magical daggers, slings, swords, and other items typical to halfings by using the Crucible of Blackflame. Cost and time for construction are left to the DM's discretion.

## Doors

Doors are common in most dungeons. Many doors are locked, and many others are stuck. If locked, a door cannot be opened until a thief unlocks it or until a magic-user casts a *knock* spell upon it. Any unlocked door can be easily opened by any monster. After a door is opened, it will usually slowly swing shut unless a spike is used to wedge the door open or it is held open.

## "Open Doors" Ability

A stuck door can be *forced open* by any character. If a player says "I'll open the door," roll 1d6. If the result is 5 or 6, the door is successfully forced open. This roll should be modified by a character's Strength score adjustment, but a roll of 6 should *always* open a stuck door.

The attempt may be made once per round per character. However, if the first attempt fails, monsters on the other side of the door cannot be surprised; they have heard the noise.

## Secret Doors

Any character may search for secret doors. The player must describe the exact area being searched. This takes about one turn for each 10' x 10' area searched. If a player says "My character will look for secret doors," roll 1d6. You should *always* roll, whether a secret door is there or not, to keep the players guessing. If there is a secret door and the result is a 1, the character has found the secret door. Elves find secret doors with a roll of 1 or 2.

Once a secret door has been found and its exact location noted on a map, anyone reading that map can find the secret door later (no roll necessary). A secret or hidden door may *not* be opened until it has been found.

## Special Doors

Some doors may be made to open only in one direction. Such doors may not be forced open from the wrong side, but will open normally if a *knock* spell is used (from either side).

## Equipment Not Listed

Beginning players should not be allowed to purchase equipment other than the items given on the lists in Chapter 4 unless you decide otherwise. If a player wants a piece of equipment not listed and you decide to allow it, you must decide on its cost, encumbrance, and other characteristics; if you allow the player to come up with the equipment characteristics, you could end up with unbalanced equipment entering the campaign and becoming a problem.

## Haste Spell

There are many magical ways for creatures to move and fight at greater than normal speed; the most common is the *haste* spell. The following rules apply in such situations.

1. Saving throws are never affected by speed differences.
2. Hit rolls gain a +2 bonus for each speed difference. A *hasted* character who drinks a *poison of speed* thus gains a total bonus of +4 to all attack rolls against opponents moving at normal speed, but only a +2 bonus against singly *hasted* opponents. This bonus only affects hit rolls, not damage rolls.
3. The armor class of a *hasted* creature is not different from its AC at normal speed, but it receives a -2 AC bonus for the next speed effect. Thus, a fighter wearing plate mail and shield (AC 2) is treated as AC 0 if "double-speeded" (such as from both the *poison* and the *spell*).
4. Wands, staves, rods, spells, and other magical effects are not affected by speed. Magic *always* takes standard time to use, without bonuses or penalties for speed effects.
5. A maximum of two *different* types of speed may be cumulative. For example, if a character drinks a *poison of speed* and is *hasted*, the character moves at four times normal rate—twice normal from the potion, and twice normal from the spell. Four *times normal* is the *maximum possible rate increase*; attempts at "triple speeding" or faster rates always fail. For every level of speed, double the number of attacks the character can make that round.
6. Identical types of speed are *not* cumulative. If a *haste* spell is cast on a character who is already under the influence of another *haste* spell, the second spell has no effect.
7. The DM may add other restrictions as desired. For example, problems in communication can develop through speed differences, especially when a character moving at four times normal speed tries to talk with others moving at normal speed.

Speed can be an extremely valuable tool for characters in combat. If the bonuses gained by speed give the PCs too much power, you should add any controls needed to keep the game balanced and entertaining.

## Listening

Any character may listen for noises. This occurs most often at doors, but may occur anywhere. For a character to attempt listening, the area must be quiet to result in any success. Near a waterfall, for example, listening is nearly impossible. If the area is quiet, all the characters must also be quiet to have any success. This means that everyone must stop and wait while one or more characters listen, because armor, weapons, and other items make noise when characters are moving.

If any player says "I'll listen for noises," roll 1d6. You, the DM, should always roll, whether or not there is anything to hear, to keep the players guessing. If the result is a 1 (1-2 for a dwarf, elf or halfing), the character will hear any noise being made, if conditions permit success.

A 1st or 2nd level thief has the same chances to Hear Noise as a demihuman. As he gains more levels, the thief becomes more adept at hearing noises.

## Magic-User Spell Choice

When a player starts a magic-user or elf character, the player will ask you what spells the character has in the spell book. The magic-user's teacher is a higher level NPC magic-user, and the spells come from the teacher. The "spell book" assumed in the game can simply be a list of spells kept on the character sheet. You may play the role of the teacher if you wish, but this may also be assumed.

This system for spells allows you, the DM, to keep control of the spells used in the game. For example, you may wish to avoid *charm person* spells. You can avoid it simply by not giving it to the characters. (You'll have to make sure that the characters never find a scroll or another magic-user's spell book with the spell on it, too.)

The first spell given should always be *read magic*. This allows the character to read scrolls found, and would be a basic part of the character's training.

The second spell given to a beginning magic-user character should be fairly powerful. You should avoid giving *detect magic*, *light*, or *protection from evil* as the second spell, as these are nearly the same as the clerical versions (easily acquired by a 2nd or higher level cleric).

For magic-user characters, good "second spells" are *charm person*, *magic missile*, *sleep* (all useful attack-type spells), and *shield* (a valuable protection).

The *floating disc*, *hold portal*, *read languages*, and *ventriloquism* spells are useful; however, the player of a beginning magic-user may feel useless in an adventure if "miscellaneous" spells (which includes *read magic*) are the only ones he knows. These spells make good "third spells," when the character reaches second level.

You may wish to give one spell to one beginning magic-user and a different spell to another beginner. This increases the number of different spells available to a party. However, be sure to give spells fairly. Try to give one powerful spell to each, to avoid complaints of unfairness.

## Lost Spell Books

If a magic-user or elf character loses a spell book, the character has a big problem. Nobody would allow the character to use a borrowed book, and without a book the character has no spells to memorize! You should always offer some method for the character to find a lost book or gain a new one. This should not be easy; it may involve paying a large sum of money (or an unbreakable promise to pay in the future), a special service or journey, dangerous adventure, or some other method. Remember that the character is heavily penalized by the loss of the book, and the player will probably not have much fun until it is recovered.

## Mapping

Mapping a dungeon is one of the biggest problems for beginning players. You can make it easier by following some simple guidelines:

1. Describe areas clearly and accurately. If you make a mistake, tell the players right away, and make necessary corrections.
2. Use the same terms in descriptions, and try to describe room details (size of the room, exits, creatures, other contents) in the same order each time. If the players become familiar with certain often-used terms, they can map more easily. Some common terms for corridors are:

Side passage (or Sideroad): A corridor branches off to one side, but the main corridor continues.

Four-way intersection: Corridors branch off to both sides of the main corridor.

T-intersection: The main corridor ends at an intersection where corridors continue left and right.

1. Set a standard description at the start of the adventure for corridors, rooms, walls, and other typical features. For example, if you start by saying "A standard corridor is 10' wide and 10' high," you can simply say "standard corridor" instead of describing it each time. Standard walls might be "made of stone blocks, each 2' long and 1' tall, mortared on all sides," and no further wall description is needed unless it differs from the standard.

1. When you design your own dungeons, use straight corridors and square rooms at first. You may try other shapes and twisted corridors when you and the players are more experienced—but even then, it will still slow down the game.

## Multiple Characters

You should not allow beginning players to play more than one character at the same time. It can be hard enough to play the role of one character; two or more can be very confusing. However, when the players are more experienced, you may consider this as an optional system.

You might run several different campaigns in your fantasy game world; if so, you may allow each player to have a character in each campaign. This can be more interesting, and allows the players to try different classes.

## New Items and Monsters

Experienced Dungeon Masters often make up their own monsters, treasures, spells, and so forth. This is *not* recommended for beginners. The entire game system is carefully balanced, and it is easy for a beginning DM to create a too-powerful item; such an item is very hard to get rid of once it has been put into the game.

When you start to include your own creations, start out by making them similar to those in this book. Magical items usually have charges, monsters and character classes all have strengths and weaknesses. For magical items, familiarize yourself with the rules for magic item creation in Chapter 16 (page 250).

## Overusing Dice

New Dungeon Masters often make the common mistake of using random dice rolls to determine everything. An entire evening can be spoiled if (for example) an unplanned wilderness encounter on the way to the dungeon goes badly for the party. The DM must use good judgment in addition to random tables. Encounters should be scaled to the strength of the party and should be in harmony with the theme of the adventure; whenever possible, they should be worked into the story the characters are playing out.

Likewise, the DM may choose numbers instead of rolling for the amount of damage, number appearing, etc. This may be necessary to allow for a more enjoyable game; heavy damage early in the game may spoil the fun.

## Reality Shifts

A DM may occasionally decide to change a procedure that has been used in many previous games. Rule changes and additions can usually be introduced by some logical means such as finding a new spell on a long-forgotten scroll, or a magical weapon could be stolen by NPC thieves to remove it from play.

Sometimes a change cannot be logically explained. For broad and basic rule changes, work with your players to develop a logical explanation. If no other method presents itself, a reality shift may be the only option.

A reality shift means that the DM and the players have decided that they want to play the game by different rules. Do not try to replay past events or adventures that may have hinged on the changed rule. Either reconsider the results of such encounters (modifying treasure, XP, and items gained thereby) or just ignore the past completely.

Avoid reality shifts wherever possible, applying changes by inventing logical reasons for their existence.

## Record Keeping

A Dungeon Master must often keep track of large amounts of information. The following guidelines are provided as suggestions on how to turn a disorganized mess into a neat, well-run game.

## Timekeeping

A DM can keep a firm grip on game events if always aware of the exact game time. Many effects have given durations, and all actions take time. While PCs stroll about dungeon corridors, NPCs and monsters may be busily engaged in their own affairs, some of which may affect the party at some point—but when?

Good records of actions taken help organize timekeeping. During a very active encounter, keeping track of time can help eliminate confusion and help you keep track of durations of effects, movement, and when foes can enter or leave combat. Make a *timetrack*, a simple list of numbers, and mark off time as it passes. Rounds, turns, hours, and days can thus be accounted for.

The timekeeping note sheets can be discarded after the adventure is over, but the DM may wish to make permanent notes of the dates and places of unusual or disastrous events, encounters, or other details.

## Character Records

If a DM keeps his own file of information about player characters, he can find important details about them quickly, even during games. He can either keep a full copy of their character sheets or put compressed data on an index card. The player isn't allowed to keep back any information about his character; the player must at all times divulge any details about his character to the DM.

At a minimum, the DM will need the following information about each PC: The character's name, armor class, hit points, alignment, class and level, experience points, ability scores, THAC0, saving throws, weapons, temporary magical items, permanent magical items, and the player's name.

The DM may also want to know special details, such as XP, gear, cash totals, thief abilities, magic-user spell books, dominion details and income, location in the game world, items or information sought, etc.

See Appendix 3 for photocopiable character sheets you can use for these purposes.

### NPC Data

The DM should also fill out a character sheet for each NPC that might go on an adventure with a party. For convenience's sake, the DM should make up NPC sheets in the same format as the PC character sheets.

In addition to the usual information, an NPC's record should indicate the NPC's home town (or the area in which the NPC can be found) and his personal characteristics and motives (stubborn, costly to hire, flamboyant, etc.).

## Adventure Record Sheets

To help a DM organize an adventure and run it swiftly, he may wish to prepare an adventure record sheet. Take a sheet of paper and, at the top left corner, write the real date and the date of the adventure in campaign time. Note the characters' mission or primary activity for that day's adventure at the top right corner of the paper.

Use the copies of the record sheets you have for all PCs and NPCs taking part in the current adventure. Copy the information you most need during the game, including each character's name, class, and level.

In Appendix 3, you'll find a full-sized copy of this adventure record sheet. You can photocopy it and use one record sheet for each adventure you play.

### Abbreviations on the Adventure Record Sheet

Not all the abbreviations on the Adventure Record Sheet from Appendix 3 are explained below; some should already be familiar to you.

*NA*, *AC*, and *hp* are the number of monsters appearing, their armor class, and hit points, respectively. If two or more monsters are encountered, use the second line below the monster entry to list their hit points. Multiple monsters should be numbered to avoid confusion. Be sure to leave room beside each hit points figure to keep track of wounds.

*THACO* is the score the monster needs to hit armor class zero (0).

*#AT* and *Damage* are the number of attacks made in one round and the range of damage each attack causes. If the monster has special attacks, try to abbreviate these attacks as one word or a phrase.

*Stw* and *Sts* are the monster's saving throws vs. wands and spells, respectively. These two are the most commonly used during encounters with well-equipped characters.

*ML* is the morale of the monsters. Monsters should not always fight to the death. However, the DM may decide how a monster will react instead of using the optional morale rules.

XPV is the XP value of one creature.

### Using the Adventure Record Sheet

Whenever magic affects a character, note the nature of the effect and its duration to the right of the character information. Use abbreviations whenever possible, to save space.

As game time passes, deduct from all magical effects durations. When a character would be aware of an exact duration, warn the player when only a brief time remains.

An alternate method of keeping track of durations is to mark on the timetrack the exact game

time when the effect disappears. When that much time has been marked off, the DM knows that the spell effect has ended.

To speed up play, make notes on encounters ahead of time on the dungeon or wilderness counter key. To save even more time, put statistics of monsters on the prepared notes. The DM may also have notes on the details of magical treasures, or at least the book and page references where complete information can be found.

When the combat ends, make the calculations for experience point awards and circle the total for that encounter. Note all treasures found as well, and if they are taken by the party. You may wish to keep separate treasure records for each character for encumbrance calculations.

When the time comes to end the adventure, the DM has all the relevant experience notes on the adventure record. Total and divide the experience point awards, and remind players of the treasure found so they may divide it as they wish. Note all results on the record sheet.

## Placement During Encounters

If the DM keeps track of monster and PC locations by memory alone, he sometimes makes errors. Miniature figures or other items to represent the opponents are useful for visualization and are best used on a gridded playing surface to indicate distances. A surface that can be further marked to indicate walls, furniture, etc. is ideal.

If miniature figures are not available, try making abstract playing aids to represent monsters. These can be as simple as scraps of paper with numbers on them, dice, or pieces of round wooden dowel, each about an inch high and marked with a color and a number. With only four colors and single-digit numbers, an accurate account can be kept of up to 36 monsters. Players can identify their opponents by number and color ("I hit red spectre #7 for 12 points!"), and the DM can use the same identification in private records.

Another alternative is chalk and an inexpensive chalkboard for making diagrams. The DM will still need to keep separate records of monster hit points, but all creature positions can be easily changed.

## Retiring Characters

For a variety of reasons, a player or the DM may decide that a character should be retired. A player may lose interest in a character. The DM might then make the character an NPC and have him reappear during later adventures. That character might still rise in levels, but at a lesser rate of experience progress. Discarded characters who were fully developed in the past are ideal for new players who want to play established characters in a campaign.

The DM may decide that a character is no longer suitable for a particular campaign due to an excess of money, items, or power, or some other reason. Before retiring the character, the DM should discuss the problem with the player and try to find alternatives. Remember that a properly played but too-powerful character may be suitable for another DM's campaign.

# Chapter 13: Dungeon Master Procedures

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_149_Picture_2.jpeg)

Whenever any character is retired from play, provide the other characters with logical reasons for the disappearance. An adventurer might move away (to another continent or region), die of natural causes or old age, mysteriously disappear, or just retire from the adventuring life.

## Special Character Conditions

Characters sometimes find themselves in unusual situations—situations that limit their effectiveness or options. Here are some of those situations and their effects.

### Blindness

Characters can be blinded by a variety of effects. For example, a *light* or *continual light* spell may be cast directly on a character's eyes, or a character without *infravision* may find himself in an area of complete darkness.

A character who is completely blind, for whatever reason, suffers a -4 penalty to all saving throws, a -6 penalty to all attack rolls (he has to guess where his target is by hearing), and a +4 penalty to his armor class for the duration of his blindness.

A character who is forced to travel great distances while blind must move very slowly. If he is to walk slowly enough that he will not fall down steps and walk unknowing into pits, he must move at one-third his normal speed . . . and, whether he is indoors or outdoors, that speed is measured in *feet*, not yards.

A blind character who is guided by a sighted character can move safely at two-thirds his normal rate, and his movement is measured in yards when outdoors. A character mounted on a horse suffers no movement penalty if someone else is guiding that horse.

### Deafness

A character made deaf by magic (a curse or a *horr ofblasting*, for example) is certainly inconvenienced. Since he cannot hear, he will miss many warnings shouted at him by his allies (the deaf character should make a saving throw vs. death ray; if he fails it, he is facing the wrong way when the warning is called). A curse of deafness would be cured by a *remove curse* spell, while deafness caused by a *horr ofblasting* could be cured by a *curall* spell.

### Invisibility

A character who cannot see his opponent due to an *invisibility* spell suffers a -6 penalty to all attack rolls made against his invisible foe; he has to guess where his target is by hearing. He suffers no penalty to his AC when attacked by an invisible character. Remember, someone who attacks loses the bonuses of *invisibility*!

### Paralysis

Various types of spells and monster attacks *can paralyze*, or "freeze," a character. If a character is hit by a paralyzing attack and fails a saving throw vs. paralysis, the character is immobilized and unable to do anything. The

character is *not* dead, and a character cannot die from mere paralysis.

A paralyzed character remains awake and aware of what is happening around him, but cannot do anything that requires movement (including speaking, spellcasting, and so forth) until the paralysis ends.

Hand-to-hand attacks on a paralyzed character automatically hit, but an edged-weapon attack will not automatically kill a paralyzed character as it would a sleeping character. Ranged attacks are made against the victim as if he were AC 9.

Paralysis itself has no permanent effects of any kind. It lasts for 2d4 turns (unless a different number is given in the monster or spell description). The cleric spell cure *light wounds* can be used to remove the paralysis, but will not cure any damage when used for this purpose.

### Prone Characters

A character who has fallen (e.g., been knocked over in combat) is easy to hit: Attackers receive a +4 bonus to their attack rolls when attacking a fallen foe.

A fallen foe also has a -4 penalty to all saving throws and a -2 penalty to attack rolls while on the ground.

A character on the ground takes one round of movement to stand up; also, for the rest of the round after he has stood up, the character still suffers the penalties of a fallen character.

### Sleep and Unconsciousness

A sleeping character is helpless. If an attacker can come up to a sleeping character without waking that character, he can kill the sleeper with a single blow of any edged weapon, regardless of the victim's hit points.

Attacks on a sleeping character made with other (i.e., blunt) hand-to-hand weapons automatically hit; ranged attacks are made against the victim as if he were AC 9.

Any sleeping creature, including one hit by a *sleep* spell, can be awakened by force, such as a shake, slap, or kick.

Some types of sleep are so heavy that the character will not awaken when disturbed; they are defined with individual spell or combat-result descriptions, and are normally referred to as unconsciousness. A victim of unconsciousness is much like a sleeper, but will not awaken and cannot resist when being tied up.

## Starvation and Dehydration

A character begins to starve after one full day without food. For every full day a character goes without either food or water, roll one die of the type specified below. The result is the number of hit points he loses. While starving, the character cannot heal naturally, and healing spells do not restore hit points lost from starvation until the character is no longer starving.

As a character loses hit points, he gradually becomes less and less effective, as the Starvation Table below shows. To use the table, find out what percentage of the character's hit points he has lost to starvation: Divide the character's unmodified hit point total into the number of hit points lost to starvation. (For example, a fighter with 32 hit points who has lost 10 hit points to starvation has lost about 31% of his hit points to starvation: 10/32 = 0.3125.) Compare that result to the table. (You can also use this table to determine the effects of starvation on monsters.)

### Stunning

Certain types of spells, attacks, or magical effects can stun a character. The duration of the stun is determined by the type of attack; the description of each type of attack that can stun will describe its duration.

A stunned character suffers the following penalties:

1. The stunned character cannot attack anyone for the first turn he is stunned (or until the stun wears off, if that is faster); after the first turn, he is at a -4 to hit until the stun wears off.
2. He moves at one-third the normal movement rate for whatever speed he is attempting.
3. He suffers a -4 penalty to all his saving throws.
4. He suffers a +4 penalty to his armor class (thus an AC 5 becomes a 9).
5. He cannot concentrate, cast spells, or use magical items.
6. He cannot use general skills.
7. Any weapon mastery the character possesses above Basic level is reduced to Basic level.

The cleric spell cure *light wounds* can be used to remove the stun effect, but will not cure any damage when used for this purpose.

| Starvation Table   |                        |            |              |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Character Has      | Hit Point Loss         |            |              |
| No Food            | 1d2/day                |            |              |
| No Water           | 1d8/day                |            |              |
| No Food & No Water | 1d10/day               |            |              |
| Percentage of hp   | Must Rest<br>(per day) | Movement   | Penalty to   |
| 0%-24%             | 6 hours                | No Penalty | Attack Rolls |
| 25%-49%            | 8 hours                | x 3/4      | -2           |
| 50%-74%            | 10 hours               | x 1/2      | -4           |
| 75%-99%            | 12 hours               | x 3/4      | -6           |

## Chapter 13: Dungeon Master Procedures

### Thief Abilities

All DMs should be familiar with the special abilities of thieves. If you are not, turn to Chapter 2 and read the description of the thief class (page 21). Many dungeon designs include several traps for thieves to find and remove, locks for them to open, and sheer walls for their special climbing skills.

When a player says "My thief character will try to . . ." and names one of these abilities, you must roll to determine the success of the attempt. All of a thief's abilities are checked by rolling percentage dice (d%).

Ask the player what his percentage chance is for the skill used. If you keep records of the characters, be sure that the thief's percentages are in your records and that the player's records match yours. Roll the percentage dice. (The DM always does this; the player does not.) If the result is less than or equal to the listed chance of success, the attempt succeeds.

A failed attempt will often simply have no result. The thief will know, for example, that the lock has not been opened, that no traps were found, that the wall was not climbed, and so forth. However, a failed attempt at Remove

Traps may set off the trap (DM's decision), or may leave it to be triggered when a certain action occurs (opening the chest or door, lifting the item, etc.).

Attempts to use the Move Silently or Hide in Shadows abilities will always *seem* successful to the thief. Only the DM knows for sure, based on the result of the roll.

The DM may decide on any result without rolling. For example, if a party is being chased by an unbeatable monster and a locked door stands between them and the exit, you may automatically allow an Open Locks ability attempt to succeed, to make the game more fun by allowing the party to escape—possibly after fighting the creature for a short time.

### Transferring Characters

A player may come to your game with a character created somewhere else. If this occurs, examine the character sheet carefully. In general, you may allow the character to "transfer" into your game *unless*:

1. The character is of a higher level than the other characters in the game

1. The character owns more or better magical items are owned than by other characters
2. The character's treasure amounts to more than 50% greater than the amount owned by any other character in your game

Any one of these problems may be corrected, simply by changing the details on the character sheet. But if allowed to remain unchanged, any one of them can unbalance encounters you have set up. If any changes are necessary, you should talk about them with the player, in private, before the game.

When an experienced character comes into your campaign, you may also want to establish how he came here. If the character's former campaign is set on a world very similar to your campaign world, you can pretend that he had his previous adventures on this world all along, and describe to the other PCs what they've heard about this character. If the former campaign was on a distinctly different world, you can describe the magical process that brought him here (perhaps he slid down the wrong worm-hole during planar travel, or offended an Immortal who expelled him from his original world).

# Chapter 14: Monsters

![Decorative monster icon]()![](_page_151_Picture_1.jpeg)

"monster," technically, is any creature that is not a player character. This chapter describes many different types or monsters; these monsters are listed in alphabetical order.

Monsters are not always ravenous beasts that automatically attack PCs and ferociously fight to the death. Monsters may be friendly or unfriendly, wild or tame, normal or bizarre. Some will be random, dangerous encounters; some will be long-term enemies of the PCs; some will be one-time or permanent allies of the PCs. The Monster Reaction Table from Chapter 7 can be used to determine how monsters respond to the PCs at first if desired.

## How to Read Monster Descriptions

Each entry on the following pages has a description of the monsters, often including notes on their behavior. Every monster is described in the same manner.

### Monster Name

If the name of a monster is followed by an asterisk (\*), then a *special* or *magical* weapon is needed to hit that monster. The monster's description tells what sort of weapon is needed. Use these monsters with caution; they are very dangerous to low-level characters who may not have the right type of weapon to effectively fight such creatures.

### Monster Statistics

Just as the player characters have abilities (Strength, Dexterity, etc.), monsters have statistics. Every monster in this chapter has the following set of statistics:

Armor Class:

Hit Dice:

Move:

Attacks:

Damage:

No. Appearing:

Save As:

Morale:

Treasure Type:

Intelligence:

Alignment:

XP Value:

Armor Class (AC)

This number works just like a character's armor class: the lower the number, the harder it is to hit the creature.

A monster's armor class is determined by the creature's speed and dexterity, the toughness of skin, and armor worn (if any). The DM may adjust the armor class for special situations. For example, a hobgoblin is normally armor class 6 (probably wearing leather armor), but may be changed to armor class 2 if the hobgoblin somehow finds plate mail armor.

#### Hit Dice (HD)

This gives the number of *eight-sided dice* (d8) used to find the monster's hit points. A line reading "Hit Dice: 11" means that the creature has 11d8 hit points.

Some Hit Dice numbers are followed by adjustments (a plus or minus followed by another number). For example, "Hit Dice: 3 + 1" shows the number of Hit Dice (3) and an adjustment (+1). The adjustment is the number of hit points added to or subtracted from the total of the dice; for instance, with a Hit Dice 3 + 1 creature, the DM would roll 3d8 and add 1 to the total. If he rolled 14 on the dice, the creature has 15 hit points.

If an asterisk (\*) appears next to the Hit Dice number, the monster has a *special ability* (usually either magical spells, a special attack, or a special defense) which will be explained in the creature's description. A creature may have several asterisks by its Hit Dice figure, one for each special ability. Special abilities affect the number of experience points the characters earn for defeating the monster, as explained in Chapter 10.

Beside the Hit Dice number will be an abbreviation (S), (M), or (L). (S) stands for "Small" or "Smaller Than Man-Size," meaning that these creatures are smaller than most humans. (M) means "Medium" or "Man-Size," meaning that they are comparable in size with humans. (L) means "Large" or "Larger Than Man-Size," meaning that they are substantially larger than full-grown humans. Remember that halflings have a defensive bonus against all creatures of this size.

Move (MV)

This gives the movement rate for the monster. Usually, on this line, you'll see two numbers, with the second number in parentheses. The first number is the number of feet the monster moves in one 10-minute turn; the second number is the movement rate per round (for encounters).

Some monsters have a second movement rate. The first is the rate when walking, and the second is a special form of movement, such as swimming, flying, or climbing.

Attacks (#AT)

This gives the number and type of attacks the monster can make in one round. Some monsters have additional special attacks, described later.

Damage (Dmg)

This line tells you the amount of damage a monster inflicts if its attack succeeds, given as the roll of one or more dice. When a monster has more than one attack in a round, the attacks and damages are given in the same order. "By weapon" means that the monster always attacks with a weapon; the damage is determined by the weapon type. A monster using a normal sword will do normal damage for the normal sword, plus any damage bonuses listed on this line or in the monster description.

A typical entry for damage might read "Damage: 1d6/2d6." The first attack listed under "Attacks" causes 1d6 points of damage and the second one listed causes 2d6 points of damage.

No. Appearing (NA)

This line, "Number Appearing," shows the number of monsters that can be encountered. The first number shows the number of monsters normally found in a dungeon room. The second number (in parentheses) gives the number

found outdoors in wilderness. If either number is zero, the monster is not normally found in that location. The DM can always adjust the number according to the situation.

**Dungeon Encounters:** The first No. Appearing figure applies to dungeon encounters. Find the level of the dungeon upon which the encounter occurs. If the monster's level (Hit Dice) is equal to the level of the dungeon, use the listed No. Appearing. If the monster's level is greater than the dungeon level, reduce the No. Appearing for this encounter (at least one will appear). If the monster's level is less than the dungeon level, then increase the No. Appearing for this encounter. If the creature is encountered in its dungeon lair, the No. Appearing can be multiplied by up to *five times*, but the DM must use his or her judgment when increasing monster numbers to avoid overwhelming the player characters.

**Wilderness:** The second No. Appearing figure (in parentheses) is used for nondungeon encounters. If the creatures are found in their wilderness lair, the No. Appearing can be multiplied by up to *five times* as above.

In any monster lair (whether in a dungeon or wilderness), up to half of the total number present may be young or very old creatures, sometimes with little or no combat ability. In addition, several adults may be absent (hunting, scouting, etc.), depending on the season, time of day, and other conditions.

Save As (Save)

This line shows you the character class and level at which the monster makes saving throws. For example, if the description says "Save: F7," then the monster saves as a 7th level fighter.

C: Cleric

F: Fighter

M: Magic-User

T: Thief

D: Dwarf

E: Elf

H: Halfling

Refer to the applicable character class description to find the exact saving throws the monster uses. As a rule of thumb, unintelligent monsters usually save as fighters of half their monster level. Some monsters may have special adjustments to some saving throws, as given in their descriptions.

Morale (ML)

This optional rule measures the monster's courage in combat. Whenever a monster needs to make a morale check (see the "Morale" section of Chapter 8) the DM rolls 2d6 against the number shown on this line. If the result is greater than the morale score, the monsters try to run away or surrender. Otherwise, the monsters continue to fight. If the monsters are encountered in their lair or have special leaders, raise their morale scores by 1 or 2 points.

Treasure Type (TT)

To find out how much and what type of treasure is being guarded by the monsters, compare the letter given here to the letters on the Treasure Types Table (both Treasure Carried and Treasure in Lair) from Chapter 16. "Nil" indicates no treasure.

If a treasure type is given in parentheses, it is the treasure *carried* by the monster rather than found in its *lair*. A wandering monster with no letter in parentheses will have *no* treasure.

### Intelligence

When a monster is hit by a *charm* or *mage* spell or whenever the DM just needs to know approximately how bright the creature is, its Intelligence can be a guideline. This line gives the *average* intelligence for a creature of this type. The DM can vary the intelligence of individual monsters, as described later in this chapter.

Monster intelligence scores range from 0 to 18+. Unthinking creatures such as insects and slimes rate an Intelligence score of 0. Common animals normally have Intelligence scores of 2. Some very bright animals (for example, pegasi) have Intelligence scores of 4 or 5, well into the human range. However, note that having scores of 3 to 5 doesn't mean these creatures think the way humans do, merely that they often seem clever in comparison with the stupidest of human beings.

### Alignment (AL)

Monsters may be Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic. Normal animals are Neutral. A good Dungeon Master always considers alignment when playing the role of a monster. For example, a Lawful monster does not normally have any reason to attack a party of player characters; even if it is guarding an area, it will first warn the characters away. Only intelligent monsters can speak an alignment language.

### XP Value (XPV)

This line indicates the experience points to be awarded for the defeat of one of that type of monster. However, the DM may give more experience points for monsters in "tough" encounters, such as an attack on a well-defended lair, or less experience points for encounters where the monsters never get to bring their abilities into play. See Chapter 10 for more details on experience point awards.

## Monster Descriptions

Below the monster statistics are paragraphs of text—the monster's *description*. Aside from the main body of the description, there may be several special paragraphs including the following:

Monster Type:

Terrain:

Load: (Optional)

Barding Multiplier: (Optional)

### Monster Type

This is a general guide as to the type of monster this creature is; different types of monsters have different sets of abilities, as described later in the chapter.

Monster types include Normal Animal (including Giant Animals and Prehistoric Animals), Lowlife (including Insects, Arachnids, Fungi, Slimes, and similar creatures), Construct, Dragon (including dragonlike creatures or Dragon-Kin), Humanoid (including Human, Demihuman, and Giant Humanoid), Monster, Planar Monster, and Undead.

"Enchanted" monsters are identified (i.e.,

the monster can only be harmed by magical weapons or is magically summoned or controlled), and these monsters can be affected by such spells as *protection from evil 10'* radius.

Monster rarity is given in parentheses whether a creature is "Common," "Rare," or "Very Rare." Common creatures will appear frequently in a campaign; rare creatures should appear only occasionally, and very rare creatures should only show up in extraordinary places or circumstances.

### Description

This is a general description of the monster's habits, appearance, special abilities, and behavior. In the description, you may find any of the following terms.

**Carnivore:** The creature prefers to eat meat and does not usually eat plants.

**Herbivore:** The creature prefers to eat plants rather than meat.

**Insectivore:** The creature prefers to eat insects rather than plants or red meat.

**Omnivore:** The creature will eat nearly anything edible.

**Nocturnal:** The creature is normally active at night, sleeping during the day. However, dungeons are often dark at night, and a nocturnal creature may be awake during "daylight hours" if found within a dark dungeon.

A monster's home is called its *lair*. Most monster lairs are in dungeon rooms or outside, hidden in the wilderness. Most monsters will defend their lairs fiercely.

### Terrain

This line describes the type of terrain the monster frequents. The monster need not be limited to this type of terrain. Terms used to define terrain include the following.

**Cavern:** This includes natural caves, deep fissures, grottoes, natural tunnel complexes, and other underground settings.

**Cold/Arctic:** These are areas of snow-capped mountains, ice-sheets, snow-covered plains, and tundra.

**Desert:** This terrain includes arid barrens, hot rocky plains, sand seas, and similar areas.

**Lost World:** This is a special area cut off from the outside world, where creatures from a bygone age live on unchanged, including prehistoric areas.

**Mountain:** These are rocky areas, including cliffs, gorges, mesas, peaks, volcanoes, and so on; it also tends to include hills, rocky barrens, and other very rough and broken terrain.

**Ocean:** Oceans include salt water seas and surface and underwater encounters. Coastal encounters are specially noted.

**Open:** This is clear or rolling ground, including grasslands, plains, savannahs, steppes, scrubland, veldt, and moorlands.

**River/Lake:** This includes freshwater encounter areas, with both surface and underwater encounter possibilities.

**Ruins:** These are ruined or abandoned buildings, artificial underground complexes (dungeons), tombs, crypts, graveyards, and similar desolate places.

**Settled:** These areas contain villages, towns, cities, and other (generally human) communities from which most dangerous creatures have been driven. The opposite of a settled area is wilder-

ness, where most adventures take place.

**Swamp:** This terrain includes swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar low, wet ground.

**Woods:** This terrain is woodland, forests, jungles, and similar terrain, including wooded hills.

### Load (Optional)

Some monsters can be harnessed to carry riders or loads of gear. Such monsters are given an encumbrance total the creature can carry. Normally, two numbers are given. The creature can carry up to the first number without difficulty; it can carry up to the second number at no more than *half its* listed movement rates. (Remember: 10 cn = 1 pound.)

### Barding Multiplier (Optional)

Some monsters that carry riders can be fitted with specially crafted *barbing* (armor for mounts). If they can use barding, that barding normally costs more and weighs more than horse barding. Choose a type of barding for the monster (see the "Armor" section of Chapter 4), note its cost and encumbrance, and then multiply that cost and encumbrance by the number shown on this line. The results are the cost and encumbrance of barding for a creature of this type.

## Abbreviated Monster Listings

In many D&D® game adventures, you will find short monster listings. These listings contain most of the information described above but use abbreviations instead of full-length terms, vastly compressing the monster information.

Here's a typical abbreviated monster listing:

Some entries slightly vary from the format shown above. Some, for instance, will alter the order in which the statistics appear and may add other information. Don't be confused by changes in order or the addition of extra statistics; the basic abbreviations are the same. Some of the extra abbreviations you'll see in variations of the short monster description include:

## Special Attacks

Many monsters have special attacks, which are mentioned in their descriptions. A character can usually avoid the effects of a special attack by making a successful saving throw (though some attacks, such as energy drain, have no saving throw).

Each special attack which a creature has gives it an asterisk (\*) beside the creature's Hit Dice figure. Read the following explanations care-

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_153_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 14: Monsters

fully and refer to this section whenever special attacks are used in a game.

## Acid

Acid damage is possible from the attacks of black dragon breath, gray ooze, and other creatures. The amount of damage done by an acid attack is given with the monster description; normal items can be ruined if the victim of the acid attack fails a saving throw.

## Blindness

Certain monster powers, spells, special actions, or fighting in the dark without infraction can result in blindness. Some forms of blindness do not involve sight; for example, a bat can be "blinded" by the clerical *silence 15'* radius spell. See "Special Character Conditions" in Chapter 13 for more details.

## Charge

If a monster can run toward its opponent for 20 yards (20 feet indoors), it inflicts double damage if it hits. A monster cannot charge in certain types of terrain: broken, heavy forest, jungle, mountain, swamp, etc.

## Charm

Some monsters can enchant a character so that the character believes that the monster is a friend. If a character is the victim of a *charm* attack (from a harpy, for example) and fails a saving throw vs. spells, the character is immediately charmed. This special attack works just like the magic-user *charm person* spell, except that the effect ends at once if the monster is killed.

## Continuous Damage

Some monsters hold on when they hit their victims. When this occurs, they need make no further attack rolls; the victim takes a given amount of damage each round, usually until the monster or its victim is killed. Constriction and blood draining are two examples of this type of special attack.

## Disease

Unless otherwise noted in the description, disease requires a saving throw vs. poison. Failure means the character has a 25% chance of dying within 1-6 days, and in any event he will need complete rest for that time. Success means the character avoids the disease. Disease can be cured at once by spells such as *cure disease*.

## Energy Drain

This is a dangerous attack form, with no saving throw allowed. If a character is hit by an energy drain attack (by a wight, for example), the character loses one level of experience. With particularly nasty energy-drainers (such as vampires), the character will lose two levels of experience. The energy drain removes all the benefits of the lost experience levels (hit points, spells, and so forth) as soon as it occurs. The victim's experience point total drops to the *mid-*

*point* of the new level. Against powerful demihumans (those who have advanced beyond level limits), the attack drains 101,000-120,000 experience points (1d20 X 1,000 + 100,000).

A 1st level character hit by an energy drain attack is killed and often returns as an undead under the control of the slayer. If not specified, this occurs 24-72 hours after death.

Lost experience levels can be regained through the 7th level clerical spell *restore* or by earning the experience through normal adventuring.

A monster hit by energy drain would lose one Hit Die from this effect, with loss of hit points and possible reduction of attack rolls and saving throws.

In general, a monster with the energy drain ability must make a conscious attack with it for the power to take effect. In other words, a vampire could pick up and carry a human without harming him or her, if the vampire wished to do so; likewise, a mystic could attack a vampire with his bare hands and not lose experience levels just from hitting the vampire.

## Paralysis

This effect "freezes" a character. If a character is hit by a paralyzing attack and fails the saving throw vs. paralysis, the character is unable to do anything (see Chapter 13, under "Special Character Conditions").

## Petrification

This is a dangerous ability of certain fantastic monsters. It may take the form of a gaze, breath, or normal hit in combat, as given in the monster description. When hit by a petrification attack, the victim must make a saving throw vs. turn to stone. A victim who fails the saving throw turns into a stone statue. All equipment carried, whether normal or magical, turns to stone with him, becoming part of the statue and not removable. Certain magical spells can restore a *petrified victim* to normal.

## Poison

Monster poison is simple and dangerous. A character hit by poison who fails his saving throw vs. poison dies; if he makes his saving throw, he is unaffected. Optionally, poison may inflict damage—for example, 1d6 per Hit Die of the creature, with a save for half damage.

## Spell Ability

This means a monster can cast one or more spells. Unless otherwise specified, the monster acts as a spellcaster of level equal to its own Hit Dice. Usually the ability is innate (that is, the monster does not require spell books or time to memorize or meditate) and will be limited to a certain number of times per day. "At will" means the monster can use the ability every round if desired. Some monster spellcasters act like magic-users or clerics. These monsters, called *wokani* and *shamans*, are detailed in the "Monster Spellcasters" section (page 215). A monster receives one asterisk (\*) for every two spell levels it can cast; thus, a creature that can cast 3rd level spells will have two asterisks for that ability.

## Swallow

Some monsters are large enough to swallow a victim whole. This attack always succeeds if the attack roll is 20 and might succeed with a lower number (given in the description). The swallowed victim takes a given amount of damage each round until the monster or the victim is killed. If the victim has an edged weapon, he may attack the monster from inside, but with a —4 penalty on attack rolls. The inside of any creature is AC 7 unless noted otherwise. Being swallowed often has effects other than damage (loss of consciousness, paralysis, etc.). If the victim dies, the body is completely digested in one hour (six turns) and cannot be recovered.

## Swoop

This attack is similar to a charge, but is performed by flying monsters. Unlike the charge, the swoop only does double damage if the monster surprises its opponent. If the attack roll is 18 or more and the monster has talons or some way to grab prey, the monster holds on and tries to fly away with its victim. If the victim is too heavy, the monster lets go immediately. A swoop cannot be used in dense forest or jungle cover.

## Trample

Some monsters try to use their large size to crush their opponents. When trampling, a monster gains a +4 bonus to its attack roll if the victim is man-sized or smaller. Some groups of animals (herds) may also trample, usually inflicting 1d20 points of damage through sheer number rather than large size.

## Special Defenses

In addition to good armor classes, high Hit Dice totals, and special attacks, some monsters have the additional special defenses of immunity to normal weapons and spell immunity.

## Immunity to Normal Weapons

Many enchanted monsters are completely immune to the effects of normal (i.e., nonmagical) weapons. These creatures are especially dangerous to low-level characters who are less likely to have magical weapons available. Some of these creatures (lycanthropes, for example) are vulnerable to silver weapons, while others are even immune to some magical weapons. For instance, some monsters are immune to normal weapons and weapons of up to a +1 magical bonus, a +2 bonus, or more. The greater the immunity, the more dangerous the monster is. Monsters with these immunities have an asterisk (\*) beside their name in the monster listing.

## Spell Immunity

This special defense may take many forms. Undead are immune to all forms of *charm*, *sleep*, and *hold* spells; many fire-using creatures are immune to fire-type spells. Some powerful creatures may be immune to spells of low power, such as all 1st and 2nd level spells, possibly in addition to immunity to a specific type of spell. When spell immunity is mentioned, it applies to all spell-like effects as well, including those produced by monsters or devices. For example, immunity to all 1st-3rd level spells also confers immunity to fireballs from a wand or staff (since *fireball* is a 3rd level spell).

However, dragon breath is a natural ability of dragons, not a magical one, and is not affected unless a description mentions it specifically.

## Monster Type

Each monster description has a line for "Monster Type." Here, these general categories of monster are described in greater detail. The categories include:

- Normal Animal (plus Giant Animal and Prehistoric Animal)  
  Construct (Enchanted Monster)  
  Dragon (and Dragon-Kin)  
  Humanoid (plus Human, Demihuman, and Giant Humanoid)  
  Lowlife  
  Monster  
  Planar Monster  
  Undead

Sometimes a monster will belong to more than one of these categories.

## Normal Animal (Giant Animal, Prehistoric Animal)

A normal animal is any sort of nonmagical creature that belongs in its environment. If a game "monster" is an animal that occurs in the real world or is a variant breed of such an animal, it is a "normal animal." A normal animal may be something as inoffensive as a field-mouse or as dangerous as a tiger.

A giant animal is simply an oversized version of a normal animal. It is not magical and does not differ in attack forms or behavior from its smaller counterpart; it is simply more dangerous because it is much larger.

A prehistoric animal is a creature that was once a normal animal in the past but has become extinct on our world; such creatures as sabre-tooth tigers, dinosaurs, and cave bears are prehistoric animals. In a game world, prehistoric animals may never have become extinct or may have become extinct in most places but still exist in isolated areas such as lost valleys.

## Construct (Enchanted Monster)

A construct is a monster that is not actually alive, but which has been created magically. Thus all constructs are also "enchanted" monsters. A lesser construct can be hit by any weapon. The lesser constructs include living statues. A greater construct can be hit only by magical weapons. They are very costly to make. The

greater constructs include gargoyleos and golems. The following general rules apply to all constructs:

1. They can be created only if the proper magical process is used. Rules for their creation are given in Chapter 16.
2. They do not heal normally; magic must be used to cure them of any damage incurred.
3. They are immune to the effects of poison (since they are not truly alive) and mental effects (*charm*, *sleep*, illusions, etc.).
4. They do not reproduce; there are never "baby gargoyleos," for example.

## Dragon (Dragon-Kin)

The dragons are among the fiercest and most dangerous of monsters. They are huge reptiles with great wings, cruel teeth, sharp claws, and a keen awareness of their own superiority. Most have "breath weapons" (i.e., attacks where they breathe out a damaging effect such as fire), many are of great intelligence, and some can cast spells. Not all dragons are evil; some are very good, benevolent creatures.

There are also dragon-kin, species related to dragons, such as chimerae, drakes, dragon turtles, hydras, salamanders, and wyverns.

## Humanoid (Giant Humanoid, Demihuman, Human)

A humanoid creature is roughly human in shape (two arms, two legs, biped) but is not human or demihuman. Lowly monsters such as goblins fall in this category, as do creatures up to ogre size. Humanoids are subject to the *charm person* spell.

A giant humanoid is like a normal humanoid, only larger and more powerful. These include true giants and creatures such as trolls. These creatures are not subject to the *charm person* spell.

A demihuman is a member of a nonhuman character class: a dwarf, elf, or halfling.

Finally, humans can be encountered nearly anywhere in a game world. They provide many opportunities for role-playing by both the DM and the players. In addition, they can be used to provide goals for the player characters and can lead to entire adventures. In some cases, the reasons for the encounter may cause some changes in nearby rooms of the dungeon. For example, if the NPCs are acting as bait, the DM may wish to place a harpy in a nearby empty room or to change a given monster to a harpy.

Since humans tend to be individuals, an encounter with humans will require some work by the DM, but the encounter can be quite entertaining. The NPC humans do not need to be as detailed as player characters. The DM may create each human NPC character in full detail or may use the Type of Human Checklist to find the necessary details. (Note: This same procedure can be used for demihumans by omitting step #2.) Use the NPC Reasons for Appearing Checklist to generate some encounter ideas.

### Type of Human Checklist

1. Find Number Appearing
2. Determine Class of each (roll 1d12):

| 1-2  | Cleric     |
|------|------------|
| 3-6  | Fighter    |
| 7-8  | Magic-user |
| 9-10 | Thief      |
| 11   | Druid      |
| 12   | Mystic     |

1. Determine Alignment of each (choose or roll 1d6):

| 1-3 | Lawful  |
|-----|---------|
| 4-5 | Neutral |
| 6   | Chaotic |

1. Find the reason for the NPCs' appearance. Select one from the checklist below or roll 1d8.
2. Select the equipment for the NPCs. Magical items may be added if desired. If so, the items should be used by the NPCs whenever needed. Remember that the NPCs' items may become party treasure if the NPCs are slain, and powerful items should not be given out carelessly.
3. Add other details as necessary, either by selecting or rolling randomly for armor class, hit points, spells, and so forth.

### NPC Reasons for Appearing Checklist

1. **Alone, Injured (and Scared):** The NPCs had set out by themselves on an adventure but discovered that the dungeon is more dangerous than they expected. They wish to join the PC party for safety.
2. **Bait:** The NPCs are bait, either *charmed* or controlled by a nearby monster. The NPCs will attempt to lead the party to the monster's location without creating suspicion. The monster may appear while the NPCs distract the party.
3. **Escaping:** The NPCs were prisoners of a nearby monster but have escaped. They have little or no equipment. The monster might appear soon if aware of their escape.
4. **Looking for a Friend:** The NPCs are looking for a friend, either rumored or known to have disappeared in the dungeon. The friend might be a prisoner of a nearby monster.
5. **Looking for an Item:** The NPCs are looking for a special item either rumored or known to be in the dungeon.
6. **Not What They Seem:** The NPCs are not mere humans. They may be lycanthropes, doppelgangers, gold dragons, etc. The DM should determine the monster type and run the monsters normally.
7. **Running Away:** The NPCs are running away from an encounter with a nearby monster. The monster may be chasing them.
8. **Sole Survivors:** The NPCs are the only survivors of a recent battle with monsters. The remains of the rest of their party may be found in a nearby monster lair.

# Chapter 14: Monsters

## Lowlife

The **lowlife** creatures are, for the most part, nonintelligent (Intelligence 0) and have simple lifestyles. Most are plants, fungi, insects, arachnids, slimes, oozes, or other invertebrates such as worms or slugs. The category also includes specimens of huge size.

## Monster

A **monster** is any creature that does not fit into one of the other categories. They tend to be legendary or fabulous creatures, but otherwise may have little in common with each other. Some resemble members of other groups (humanoids or animals, for example) but have abilities or powers that set them apart.

## Planar Monster (Enchanted Monster)

All **planar monsters** have one thing in common: they come from a plane of existence other than the Prime Plane (the dimension that is the player characters' home). Some monsters will have both Prime Plane and other planar versions; these will be noted. Planar monsters that are summoned or gated to the Prime Plane are "enchanted" monsters as well.

Most other-planar creatures do not have "normal" treasures but may have the equivalent in the material of their own planes. For example, valuable gems on the elemental plane of Water may appear as bits of colored ice. When the treasure type given is "Special," the DM may change the treasures to match the plane.

## Undead

The **undead** are creatures that were once alive but now owe their existence to powerful supernatural or magical forces upon their spirits or bodies. Most undead can be repelled by clerics or certain objects, such as holy symbols. Undead are not affected by special attacks that affect only living creatures (such as poison) or by spells that affect the mind (*sleep*, *charm*, *hold*, *discord*, *insanity*, *feeblemind*, etc.). Undead created by magical spells are "enchanted" monsters.

## Monster Frequency

Monsters are listed as being *common*, *rare*, or *very rare*. Rare monsters should be used less frequently than common monsters. Very rare monsters should usually appear in carefully planned encounters or in seldom-visited settings.

## Monster List

This is the basic list of monsters for the D&D® game. Other monsters are introduced in adventures and supplements published for the game.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

This solitary creature is a protector of woodland creatures. The actaeon is 9' tall, with the arms, torso, and facial features of a human but the antlers and lower legs of an elk; its whole body is covered with brown elklike hide.

It can camouflage itself perfectly (as if *invisible*) in light or dense woods. When angered by the wanton slaying of woodland creatures (or similar vile acts), the actaeon springs out of hiding, usually with surprise (1-5 on Id6). It often uses large wood and bone spears to punish or slay the defilers of the woods.

It has a powerful breath weapon that can be used once per day, filling a  $10' imes 10' imes 10'$  cube;

each victim within it must make a saving throw vs. dragon breath or be *polymorphed* into a normal forest creature (owl, squirrel, deer, etc.). If the saving throw is successful, the transformation still occurs, but lasts for only 24 hours.

Once per day an actaeon may summon woodland creatures to assist it; Id6 creatures arrive in Id4 turns. Choose or randomly determine the types of creatures appearing:

1. boar
2. bear
3. centaur
4. griffin
5. lizard (chameleon)
6. treat

Actaeons are members of the woodland community along with centaurs, dryads, etc. They are sufficiently bold and rare that they are renowned heroes of these forest folk. Actaeon sometimes work with druids to preserve the safety of the woods, especially if a dangerous threat is involved.

There can be actaeon spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" on page 215.

**Terrain:** Woods.

**Load:** 3,000 cn at full speed; 6,000 cn at half speed.

*Monster Type:* Monster (Very Rare).

Adaptors are a peculiar race native to all planes of existence. They are very intelligent, and their ancient race has greater and wider knowledge than any sage, but their cultural philosophy demands that they not pass their great knowledge between planes and human cultures. Instead, they travel and observe civilization throughout the planes, exchanging information only among themselves.

Adaptors are natural (nonmagical) polymorphs, able to change into the form of any creature of human or demi-human size. They also change color after they adapt to an attack. They are travelers, rarely staying anywhere for more than three days, and able to enter and leave other planes at will.

These creatures have the ability to adapt—to alter their physical structure to survive in any environment. Once exposed to any type of magical attack, they then become immune to it; for example, a *lightning bolt* would inflict full or half damage when first used against it, but all electrical attacks would thereafter have no effect. The adaptation fades away in 1d10 turns if not used.

In combat, adaptors are skilled at swordplay (2 attacks per round, +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls). If the DM wishes, he can have an adaptor protect itself with fantastic devices which the PCs cannot comprehend or use (if desired, designed by the DM). Examples might include a flame tube, trance inducer, or energy neutralizer.

Adaptors are not the same as doppelgangers; they cannot turn into duplicates of specific people.

*Terrain:* Anywhere humans are found.

*Monster Type:* Planar Monster, Enchanted (Rare).

Aerial servants are humanoid in shape. They appear to be man-shaped figures of roiling fog; they are eerie and menacing.

Aerial servants are beings native to the elemental plane of Air. On their home plane, they

are known by a name which sounds like "haouu." They are only encountered on the Prime Plane when conjured by a cleric (see the clerical spell *aerial servant*). They don't care to be summoned for this slave labor; they do not deliberately or maliciously misinterpret their summoners' orders, but they are hateful enemies of humans who visit the plane of Air.

Clerics can summon aerial servants to perform tasks for them. Summoned aerial servants will not fight; they only accept orders to seize things or prisoners and bring them back to the cleric. They can only be harmed by spells or magical weapons. They travel at super-speed, often surprising their prey (1-7 on 1d8). The percentage chance of breaking free of the servant's grip is equal to the victim's Hit Dice or experience level (i.e., an 18th level fighter has an 18% chance to break free of the grip).

Plane of Air: On their home plane, the haouu have their own evil empire, which reigns in places where there are few or no other creatures. Their enemies are the helions and the djinn. They fear earth-type creatures and attacks.

*Terrain:* Plane of Air; Any.

*Load:* 5,000 cn at full flying speed; 10,000 cn at half speed when retrieving items or prisoners for their temporary masters.

*Monster Type:* Normal Animal (Common).

This set of monster statistics represents most wild grazing creatures, such as caribou, deer, elk, goats, moose, and wild oxen. All but the most inhospitable climates in the world will feature at least one type of herd beast.

PCs might attack members of a herd in order to acquire meat. The Hit Dice of and damage done by herd creatures depend on the type of creatures they are. Here are some sample herd creatures:

| Type of Animal        | Hit Dice | Damage  |
|-----------------------|----------|---------|
| Antelope, Deer, Goats | 1-2 (M)  | 1d4     |
| Wild Horses, Zebras   | 2 (L)    | 1d4 + 1 |
| Caribou, Oxen         | 3 (L)    | 1d6     |
| Elk, Moose, Cattle    | 4 (L)    | 1d8     |

The DM may add other herd animals within these ranges.

In any given herd only one animal in four is male; the rest are females and young. A male has at least 3 hit points per Hit Die; females have normal hit points. Young have only 1-4 hit points per Hit Die. When alarmed, females and

young flee while the males protect them.

Any group of 16 or more may panic when attacked, running toward the disturbance 40% of the time (trampling all in their path for 1d20 points of damage; no attack roll needed).

*Terrain:* Open, Light Woods.

### Ant, Giant

| Armor Class:   | 3                 |

Giant ants are black ants about 6' long. They are omnivores and will attack anything edible that lies in their path (no reaction roll); if they win, they carry their kills back to the nest. Once engaged in combat, they will fight to the death, even trying to cross flames to reach their opponents.

A giant ant nest looks like a large, bare hill. Giant ant nests are not as heavily populated as those of smaller ants. At any given time, the nest will be protected by 4d6 giant ants, and another 10d6 will be on the trails, gathering food. There is an ant queen in the deep, well-guarded egg chamber of the ant nest.

Giant ants behave just like their smaller cousins. They wander all over the landscape, finding sources of ready food (grain warehouses, watering-holes, villages), communicate their finds to the nest, and set up a trail from the nest to the food and back.

There are legends of giant ants mining gold, and there is a 30% chance that a liar will contain 1d10 thousand gp worth of nuggets.

Snow apes are squat, baboonlike creatures with shaggy white fur. They are somewhat intelligent, and often make simple tools like clubs or sharpened bones. They cannot, however, grasp more complicated concepts, such as the use of a bow and arrow.

Because of their camouflage, they are extremely difficult to see in snowy conditions (surprising on a 1-4). The snow ape uses one arm to attack with a weapon and attempts to hug its victim with the other. Because the snow ape is so

## Chapter 14: Monsters

strong, any creature caught in its hug takes 2d6 points of damage each round until freed. The ape will maintain its hug until it is slain or its morale fails.

Although generally reclusive, the snow ape is clever and cruel, preferring to ambush its victims whenever possible. If trapped or cornered, the snow ape fights viciously (use the morale in parentheses in this case). Although they cannot make intelligible sounds, snow apes communicate with each other using a complex sign language. In addition, snow apes often leave messages for each other using a system of stacked rocks and snowballs.

Snow apes are omnivores; they like giant insects and red meat (such as humans), but will not attack very large monsters or large parties. They live in snowy mountain forests and do not need to take shelter except in the worst snowstorms.

Terrain: Arctic, Mountains (cold).

White apes have lost their color due to many years of living in caves. They are nocturnal herbivores, looking for fruits and vegetables at night.

They do not go out of their way to attack characters; if approached by humans and demi-humans and given a chance to flee, they will do so. But if creatures approach their lair, the apes will threaten the intruders. If their threats are ignored, they will attack. They may throw one stone per round for 1d6 points each.

White apes are not intelligent and are sometimes kept as pets by Neanderthals (cavemen). Normally, in the wild, they live in caves in family groups of 2-8 members.

Terrain: Cavern, Hill, Mountain, Ruin.

Monster Type: Planar Monster (Very Rare).

Archons are extremely lawful beings whose sole purpose is to oppose chaos and preserve all that is good. They do this by learning about evil

and chaotic people and monsters, persuading adventurers to attack those evils, and sometimes directly helping the adventurers who are advancing their goals.

Both male and female archons have the bodies like that of giant eagles, with golden-feathered wings. The male archon has a head, arms, and torso like a huge muscular man; the female has no torso, but has a dragonlike neck and three heads: two bull's heads flanking a beautiful female human's.

In combat, each female's bull head may gore for 3d10 points of damage or breathe a cone of fire 10' long for 4d6 points of damage. A male may use any human weapon, and many have enchanted weapons.

Archons are immune to fire, poison, and 1st through 4th level spells of all types. Archons may use spells as 12th level clerics and can teleport at will.

Once per day, each may use one *bolt of purity* and may create one *sword of flame*. The *bolt* appears similar to a *lightning bolt* (with the same size and range), but causes all victims to become Lawful and peaceful for 2d6 turns (no saving throw). It removes all evil thoughts and does not cause damage. The *sword* is the size of a normal sword but is solid flame and inflicts 4d8 points of damage to any victim hit. Once created, it lasts for three turns.

Archons live in small families of one mated pair and 1d3 young. Archons are encountered alone or in mated pairs; adventurers almost never encounter archon young.

Terrain: Any, any Planar.

Load: 5,000 cn at full speed; 10,000 cn at half speed (may carry a character at a crucial time if he is worthy).

Monster Type: Giant Humanoid (Rare).

Athachs are humanoid and stand 18' tall. Each has hideous but recognizable features, a malformed body, and a third arm in the center of its chest.

These huge monsters are quite stupid and ill-tempered. They live in small families, sheltering in caves, and beating on one another when not hunting for meat. (They consider humans to be meat.) They love gems and jewelry and, if an offer is good enough, will accept such in return for not attacking travelers.

Athachs attack by bashing their opponents with thick tree stumps or stones and biting with their gnarled, poisonous tusklike teeth. Any victim bitten must make a saving throw vs. poison with a —4 penalty or be helpless for 1d6 turns.

Terrain: Hill, Mountain, Woods.

Monster Type: Normal Animal (Common).

Rock baboons are larger versions of normal baboons and are more intelligent. They are omnivores but prefer meat. They are not inclined to eat humans, preferring small herd animals when they can catch such beasts. They do not make tools or weapons but will pick up bones or branches to use as clubs.

Rock baboons form packs of up to 30 members, each pack led by a dominant male. They are ferocious and have vicious tempers. They do not speak a true language, but use simple screams to communicate warnings and needs.

Rock baboons will not go out of their way to attack travelers, but will try to scare intruders out of their hunting grounds.

Terrain: Hill, Mountain, Open.

Monster Type: Human (Common).

Bandits are NPC thieves who have joined together for the purpose of robbing others. Frequently, they have small communities of 3-30 members and send out raiding groups of 2-4 bandits. Bandits will act as normal men so they can surprise their intended victims. Another bandit tactic is to set up an ambush to waylay wealthy travelers; typically, they will drop a tree just around the bend of a road so that travelers have to stop; then the bandits stand back with ranged weapons and rob the travelers.

Treasure Type A is only found in the bandits' wilderness lair.

Bandits may have an NPC leader of any human character class who is one or more levels of experience greater than the bandits. The leader may have an agenda other than mere robbery; he might be assembling a network of bandit gangs for some greater nefarious purpose, or he may be a nobleman framed for a crime, stripped of his title, and living the life of a bandit until he can clear his name.

Terrain: Any (usually wilderness along main roads).

*Monster Type:* Monster (Rare); Planar Monster (Very Rare).

A basilisk is a 10'-long lizard; it looks much like a large snake with four legs and a crownlike growth on its head. It may be of any color, but is usually very bright and distinctive. It is sometimes called the "king of snakes."

The basilisk is a nonintelligent but very magical lizard. It lives in underground caverns or wild and tangled thickets. Any creature hit by a basilisk must make a saving throw vs. turn to stone or be petrified; all equipment he carries will also be turned to stone. The basilisk's gaze has the same effect; anyone meeting the gaze must make the same saving throw or be petrified. A surprised character automatically meets the gaze (but gets the saving throw).

A character in hand-to-hand combat with the creature must either avoid the gaze or meet the gaze each round. When a character tries to avoid the gaze, he suffers a -4 penalty to all attack rolls against the monster, while the basilisk gains a +2 bonus to all its attacks against the character. If the character meets the gaze, he attacks and defends normally but must make the saving throw at his normal odds.

A character may use a mirror when confronting a basilisk. While using a mirror, he suffers a -2 penalty to the attack roll (instead of -4). The area must be lit for the mirror to be effective and the attacker cannot use a shield. If the basilisk sees itself in the mirror (a roll of 1 on 1d6, checked each round), it must make a saving throw or be turned to stone!

Basilisks are native to both the Prime Plane and the elemental plane of Earth.

**Plane of Earth:** On the plane of Earth, a basilisk is merely a lizardlike creature made of rock. Its 90' gaze *slows* creatures made of earth (as the reverse of the magic-user spell *haste*) for 1d6 rounds (no saving throw). The gaze can still petrify creatures not made of earth (the standard saving throw still applies).

The planar basilisk can burrow through very dense rock at a 180' (60') rate. It usually avoids other life forms on its own plane.

*Terrain:* Cavern, Woods; Plane of Earth.

*Monster Type:* Normal Bat: Normal Animal (Common); Giant Bat: Giant Animal (Common).

Bats are nocturnal flying insectivores. They often live in caves or abandoned buildings and find their way about by echolocation (a type of radar using hearing and echoes to locate objects). Since they have very weak eyes, spells that affect sight (such as *light*) do not work on bats. However, a *silence 15'* radius spell will effectively "blind" a bat.

**Normal bats:** These very small mammals weigh only a few ounces. They will not attack men but may *confuse* them by flying around their heads. *There must be at least ten bats to confuse* one character. Characters who are *confused* have a -2 penalty on their attack rolls and saving throws and cannot cast spells. Normal bats must check morale each round unless they are controlled or summoned.

**Giant Bats:** Giant bats are much larger cousins of normal bat species. Giant bats look like smaller bat species but grow to be approximately 5' long, with a wingspan greater than 25'. They are carnivores (or, more appropriately, hemovores—blood-drinkers) and may attack humans if extremely hungry.

**Giant Vampire Bats:** Of giant bat encounters, 5% will be with groups of giant vampire bats, far more dangerous creatures (HD 2\*). XP Value 25). The bite of a giant vampire bat does no extra damage but its victim must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or fall unconscious for 1d10 rounds. This will allow the vampire bat to feed without being disturbed, draining 1d4 points of blood per round. Any victims who die from having their blood drained by a giant vampire bat must make a saving throw vs. spells or become an undead creature 24 hours after death.

*Monster Type:* Black, Grizzly Bears: Normal Animal (Common). Polar Bear: Normal Animal (Rare). Cave Bear: Prehistoric Animal (Very Rare).

Bears are well known to all adventurers. If any bear hits one victim with both paws in one round, the bear hugs its victim and inflicts 2d8 points of additional damage in that same round.

**Black Bear:** Black bears have black fur and stand about 6' tall. They are omnivores but prefer roots and berries. A black bear will not usually attack unless it is cornered and cannot escape. Adult black bears will fight to the death to protect their young. They have been known to raid camps, seeking food. They are especially fond of such treats as fresh fish and sweets.

**Grizzly Bear:** Grizzly bears have silver-tipped brown or reddish brown fur and stand about 9' tall. They are fond of meat and are much more likely to attack than black bears. Grizzlies are found in most climates, but are most common in mountains and forests.

**Polar Bear:** Polar bears have white fur and stand about 11' tall. They live in cold regions. They usually eat fish, but often attack adventurers. These huge bears are good swimmers, and their wide feet allow them to run across snow without sinking.

**Cave Bear:** These enormous bears stand about 15' tall. They do not see well at all but hunt very well by scent. If hungry, they will follow a track of blood until they have eaten. They prefer a diet of fresh-killed red meat and live in caves, mostly in prehistoric environments or very distant mountain areas where human civilization has not penetrated.

*Terrain:* Hill, Mountain, Woods. (Cave Bear: Same, but prehistoric.)

*Monster Type:* Lowlife (Rare).

Giant bees, also called "killer bees," are foot-long giant bees with nasty tempers. Giant bees always attack anyone within 30' of their hive. If a giant bee attack hits, the bee dies, but the creature stung must make a saving throw vs. poison or die. The stinger will work its way into the victim, inflicting 1 point of damage per round, unless a character spends a round pulling it out.

Owing to the great weight of their hives, giant bees prefer to build their hives in small caves and underground areas near the surface.

There will always be at least 10 bees with their queen in or near the hive. At least four of these bees will have 1 Hit Die each (XP 13). The queen bee has 2 Hit Dice (XP 35) and can sting repeatedly without dying.

Giant bees make magical honey. If a character eats the honey of an entire hive (about two pints), it has an effect like a half-strength *potion of healing*, curing 1d4 points of damage.

*Terrain:* Plain, Woods, Mountain, Hill.

Fire Beetle: Fire beetles are 2 1/2'-long creatures often found below ground. A fire beetle has two glowing glands above its eyes and one near the back of its abdomen. These glands give off light in a 10' radius and will continue to glow for 1d6 days after they are removed.

Oil Beetle: Oil beetles are 3'-long giant beetles that sometimes burrow underground. When attacked, an oil beetle squirts an oily fluid at one attacker (an attack roll is needed; the range is 5'). The oil raises painful blisters, causing a -2 penalty on the victim's attack rolls until cured by a *cure light wounds* spell or until 24 hours have passed.

Tiger Beetle: Tiger beetles are 4'-long giant beetles with a striped carapace that looks like a tiger's skin. They are carnivores and usually prey on robber flies.

*Terrain:* Cavern, Plain, Ruins, Woods.

*Monster Type:* Monster (Rare).

A beholder, also called an "eye tyrant" or "sphere of many eyes," looks like a large floating ball (about 4' in diameter) covered with tough armor-plated skin. Atop the beholder are ten small eyes on stalks, each with its own magical power. A large central eye is on the front of the body, with a toothy mouth below it.

A beholder moves by means of a slow flight that cannot be dispelled. It speaks most languages and is extremely intelligent, cruel, and greedy. It is normally found alone but is rarely (5% chance) found with 1d6 young (each with 1/10 normal Hit Dice and range of eye effects, bite damage 1d4 points).

The beholder's front eye always projects an anti-magic ray, which temporarily "turns off all magic within 60' in front of it (see "Anti-Magic" in Chapter 13). Magical weapons used within the ray are treated as if nonmagical. Spells cast within it area of effect are instantly ruined; spells cast from further away are ruined when the effects get within range. The beholder will usually turn to face any character who starts casting, running the spell.

Magical weapons and items will work normally once they are removed from the anti-magic ray area, and existing spell effects with durations will resume once the ray is directed elsewhere. This ray cannot be aimed above or below the creature, but only straight out in front of it. As this ray can affect any magic, even that of the smaller eyes (as explained below), the small eyes cannot be used on targets within the anti-magic ray.

If a character uses a weapon to attack a beholder, the player must declare what his character is aiming at—the body, the large eye, or an eye stalk. Each target has a different armor class and hit points as follows:

- The body is AC 0 and has 50 hit points.
- The front eye is AC 2 and has 20 hit points.
- An eye stalk is only AC 7, but can withstand 12 of damage. Damage to eye stalks does not count toward killing the creature.

*Small eyes and eyestalks:* If an attack roll against an eye-stalk is successful, the DM should roll randomly to see which stalk is damaged. A "slain" eyestalk has been cut off, but a damaged stalk does not interfere with the eye's functioning. Lost eyes grow back in 2d4 days; partial damage to eyestalks regenerates at the rate of 1 hit point per day.

Only four small eyes can aim in one direction at the same time, and they cannot see the area directly below the body. Each eye stalk can shoot a ray with a different spell-like effect once per

**Monster Type:** Undead Construct, Enchanted (Very Rare).

An undead beholder is similar to a living one, but is a construct created for some specific evil purpose. All undead beholders are constructs; "real" beholders never become undead.

This monster looks quite similar to a normal beholder—a large floating ball, about four feet in diameter, covered with tough armor-plated skin. Atop the monster are ten small eyes on stalks, each with its own magical power. A large central eye is on the front of the body, with a toothy mouth below it. The creature moves about by magical flight, a natural (nonmagical) ability. It is extremely intelligent, and speaks many languages. Any cleric of 25th level or greater will recognize the creature as undead when he sees it.

An undead beholder cannot be harmed by normal, silver, or even +1 magical weapons; a magical weapon of +2 or better enchantment is needed to damage it. It is immune to all charm, hold, and sleep effects, all illusions, death rays, and poison.

The monster's body regenerates 3 hit points per round as soon as it is damaged. If reduced to 0 hit points, it is forced into gaseous form and cannot regenerate; it must rest for 1 hour in total darkness before the regeneration starts once again. The monster usually keeps several areas of continual darkness near its location.

An undead beholder can assume gaseous form at will. In this form, it has no special abilities, but cannot be harmed except by magic that affects air. The monster cannot use any special abilities during that round of combat in which it is becoming or leaving its gaseous form.

Its bite inflicts 2d10 points of damage and also causes an energy drain of two levels (as a vampire's).

The monster's front eye always projects a ray of reflection. Any spell cast at the monster from this direction is reflected back at the caster. In addition, any attempts to turn undead from in front is also reflected back on the cleric, who must make a saving throw vs. spells or run in fear for 2d6 rounds. The monster usually turns to face any character who starts casting a spell, and watches for clerics. This reflection cannot be aimed above or behind the creature, but only straight in front of it.

If a character uses a weapon to attack an undead beholder, the player must declare what the character is aiming at—the body, the large eye, or an eye stalk. Each target has a different armor class and hit points as follows:

- The body is AC -4, and can take 90 hit points of damage before the beholder is killed.
- The front eye is AC -2, and has 30 points.
- An eye stalk is only AC 3, but each can withstand 20 points of damage. Damage to the eye stalks does not count toward killing the creature.

**Small eyes and eyestalks:** Each small eye may be used once per round at most, and only three eyes can aim in one direction (forward, backward, etc.; if a target is above the creature, all ten small eyes can be used). The beholder often uses only two small eyes per round unless seriously threatened.

A "slain" eye is cut off, but a damaged eye functions normally. Damaged and lost eyes grow back in 1d4 + 1 hours and do not regenerate as fast as the body of the monster.

| Eye 1.  | animate dead (range 60')                                                |

**Monster Type:** Human (Rare).

Berserkers are fighters who go mad in battle. Most belong to barbarian cultures—typically, northern seagoing cultures.

Berserker reactions are determined normally outside of combat, but once a battle starts they will always fight to the death—sometimes attacking their comrades in their blind rage. When fighting humans or humanlike creatures (such as kobolds, goblins or orcs), they add +2 to their attack rolls due to their ferocity. They never retreat, surrender, or take prisoners.

Berserkers do not look different from any other members of their culture. In a village of the appropriate culture, 10% of all fighters will be berserkers. The DM can create societies where all fighters are berserkers.

**Terrain:** Any.

### Black Pudding\*

| Armor Class:   | 6         |
|----------------|-----------|
| Hit Dice:      | 10* (L)   |

| Intelligence:  | 0         |
| Alignment:     | Neutral   |
| XP Value:      | 1,750     |

**Monster Type:** Monster (Common).

A black pudding is a nonintelligent black blob 5 to 30 feet in diameter. Puddings are always hungry; they will attack any creature they come across.

With their corrosive touch, they inflict 3d8 points of damage to living things, and can dissolve wood and corrode metal in one turn. They cannot affect stone.

They can travel on ceilings and walls, and can pass through small openings. (Passing through a small opening is very slow and usually takes a full turn or longer.)

A pudding can only be killed by fire; other attacks (weapons or spells) merely break it up into smaller puddings, each with 2 Hit Dice and inflicting 1d8 points of damage per blow. However, a flaming sword will cause full normal damage.

Puddings normally have no treasure, but gems (the only remnants of previous victims) might be found nearby.

**Terrain:** Cavern, Ruins.

*Monster Type:* Planar Monster (Very Rare).

It is not known what these curious beings are, or even if they are living creatures. A blackball (or "deadly sphere") is simply a featureless black globe, 5' in diameter. It moves slowly but usually randomly. Whatever it touches simply disintegrates (no saving throw), so it moves freely through anything.

When encountered, the blackball moves toward the nearest intelligent creature within 60'. It has no recognizable mind or intelligence and is immune to everything except Immortal control. An Immortal can command a blackball, but it is beyond mortal control; fortunately, it is extremely rare. It may be defeated by a *gate* spell, sending it to some other plane, or by a carefully worded *wish*.

*Terrain:* Any.

## Blast Spore

| Alignment:     | Neutral              |
| XP Value:      | 13                   |

*Monster Type:* Lowlife (Rare).

A blast spore looks almost exactly like a beholder (see *Beholder*, above). However, it is a type of floating fungus.

When seen in dim light, a blast spore is usually mistaken for a beholder; a character must roll 10% or less on 1d100 to tell the difference. When characters come within 10', their chance for detection improves to 25%.

If a blast spore is damaged in any way, it explodes for 6-36 (6d6) points of damage to all within 20'; each victim may make a saving throw vs. wands to take half damage. This explosion does not shower victims with spores the way the normal attack does.

When approached, this creature might spray a shower of spores in a 20' x 20' x 20' volume before it. Each victim must make a saving throw vs. poison; if he fails, the spores hit him, penetrate, and grow into 1d6 more blast spores, causing death in 24 hours unless a *cure disease* spell is applied.

*Terrain:* Cavern, Ruins.

## Blink Dog

| Armor Class:   | 5            |
|----------------|--------------|
| Hit Dice:      | 4* (S)       |
| Move:          | 120' (40')   |
| Attacks:       | 1 bite       |
| Damage:        | 1d6          |

| Alignment:     | Lawful       |
| XP Value:      | 125          |

*Monster Type:* Monster (Common).

This unusual creature is a small, brown-furred, rugged-looking canine with big jaws. It is not, however, a normal animal. It is intelligent, often travels in packs, and uses a limited teleportation ability. It can "blink out" of one spot and immediately appear ("blink in") at another. It has instincts that prevent it from appearing in a solid object.

When attacking, it "blinks" close to an enemy, attacks, and then reappears 1d4 x 10' away. If seriously threatened, an entire pack will "blink" out and not reappear.

Though as intelligent as many humans, blink dogs do not speak human or demihuman languages; they can communicate only among themselves. They like to live free the way wolves do and tend to come in conflict with humans only when settlers encroach on their territories. They are carnivores, living on wild elk, moose, and other herd-beasts.

Blink dogs also hate and attack displacer beasts, their natural enemies. It is suspected that blink dogs and displacer beasts both come from some distant plane of existence.

*Terrain:* Open, Woods, Desert.

Wild boars generally prefer forested areas but can be found nearly everywhere. They are omnivores and have extremely bad tempers when disturbed. They sometimes lie in thickets in the forest and charge passersby. They do have the charge attack special ability; if they can charge for 20 yards before reaching their prey, they inflict double damage when they hit.

Great Boars: These rare boars are huge and terrifying. They are most often found in "lost world" settings and are occasionally used as mounts by barbaric tribes.

*Monster Type:* Humanoid (Common).

Bugbears are giant hairy goblins—humanoids that grow to about 8' tall and are covered with bristly dark fur.

Despite their size and awkward walk, they move very quietly and attack without warning whenever they can. They surprise on a roll of 1-3 (on 1d6) due to their stealth. When using weapons, they add +1 to all attack and damage rolls because of their strength.

In the wilderness, they live in small communities of 5-20 members, and send out hunting packs of 2-16 fighters. They kill and eat herd animals whenever possible and sometimes raid farmers' grain storage sheds and meat-smoking sheds for food; in times of great hardship, they may kill humans for food.

*Monster Type:* Lowlife (Rare).

This giant gray wormlike creature is about 30' long. They are meat-eaters and can be found nearly anywhere.

Cacilia often lie in wait in loose soil just below the surface. Whenever a small party of animals or humans pass, they shoot up out of the ground and begin biting with their large mouths and sharp teeth. An unadjusted attack roll of 19 or 20 means that the cacilia has swallowed its prey whole. A victim takes 1d8 points of damage each round until the victim or the cacilia is dead.

*Terrain:* Any except Arctic.

*Monster Type:* Normal Animal (Common).

The camel is an ill-tempered beast, apt to bite or kick any creature that gets in its way—including its owner. It often kicks with one leg.

Camels are used as pack and riding animals in deserts and barren lands (with movement as if in clear terrain). A well-watered camel may travel for two weeks without drinking. Camels are herbivores, preferring grasses and grains, but will eat animal skin and bones when very hungry.

A camel with one hump is called a dromedary, and one with two humps is a Bactrian camel.

*Monster Type:* Lowlife (Common).

This scavenger is a 9'-long, 3'-high many-legged worm. It can move equally well on a floor, wall, or ceiling. Its small mouth is surrounded by eight tentacles, each 2' long, which can paralyze on a successful hit unless a saving throw vs. paralysis is made. A tentacle hit does no actual damage.

Carrion crawlers are known as scavengers, eating the remains of slain animals. But they are also willing to go after fresh meat. They will attack small parties of travelers, paralyzing their prey, and will eat paralyzed victims in three turns unless except when the carrion crawlers are being attacked. Unless magically cured, the paralysis will wear off in 2d4 turns.

The "great cats" are large feline predators living in wilderness areas. They are cautious, normally only attacking their natural prey, small herd-beasts. They will avoid fights with humans and demihumans unless forced by extreme hunger or when trapped with no escape route.

Great cats rarely go deeply into caves and usually remember a quick escape route to the outdoors. Despite their shyness, they are very inquisitive and may follow a party out of curiosity. They will always chase a fleeing prey.

*Mountain Lion:* This tawny-furred species lives mostly in mountainous regions but also inhabits forests and deserts. They will wander further into dungeons than any other species of great cat.

*Monster Type:* Monster (Common).

A centaur is a creature with the head, arms, and upper body of a man joined to the body and legs of a horse. They are of average human intelligence and often carry weapons (clubs, lances, and bows; one weapon per creature). A centaur may use a charge attack with a lance.

Centaur will form into small tribes or families. Their homes are in dense thickets or woods. The females and young will usually stay in the lair. If attacked, females and young will attempt to flee; if escape is impossible, they will fight to the death. The young fight as 2-HD monsters, and do less damage (1d2/1d2/1d4).

There can be centaur spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters."

*Lion:* Lions generally live in warm climates and thrive in savannah and brush lands near deserts. They usually hunt in groups, known as prides. Male lions have the distinctive lion-mané; female lions do not.

*Tiger:* Tigers are the largest of the commonly found great cats. They prefer cooler climates and wooded lands where their striped bodies offer some degree of camouflage. They often surprise their prey (1-4 on 1d6) when in woodlands.

*Sabre-Tooth Tiger:* Sabre-tooth tigers are the largest and most ferocious of the great cats. They have oversized fangs, from which they get their name. Sabre-tooth tigers are mostly extinct, except in "lost world" areas.

A giant centipede is a foot-long insect with many legs. Centipedes prefer dark, damp places and are often found in dungeons or on the boles and branches of trees in deep forest. They do not commonly attack travelers, but will usually attack someone who disturbs them.

They attack by biting. The bite does no damage to characters, but the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or become violently ill for 10 days. Characters who do not make their saving throws move at half speed and will not be able to perform any other physical action. The bite is more effective against very small creatures, such as the birds and insects they eat; such creatures must save vs. poison or die.

*Monster Type:* Monster (Very Rare).

A chimera is a horrid combination of three different creatures. It has three heads (goat, lion, and dragon), the forebody of a lion, the hindquarters of a goat, and the wings and tail of a dragon.

Chimerae are rare, solitary creatures that are very territorial. They usually live in wild hills but may occasionally be found in some dungeons. They might also live in small groups—often mated pairs with one or two young.

In combat, the goat's head butts, the lion's head bites, and the dragon's head can bite or breathe fire (a cone 50' long and 10' wide at the end, for 3d6 points of damage). The breath can only be used three times per day. In a fight, the chimera has a 50% chance each round to use its breath attack; once it has used all three such attacks, it will use only its other attacks.

Occasionally, a chimera—ill-tempered and dangerous to begin with—will turn rogue. A rogue chimera flies to some distant place (usually a hill or mountain near a human community) and begin to terrorize the area, trying to drive out or kill every living thing in that region. A rogue chimera will not stop this course of action; either it kills everything and obtains itself a new territory or it is killed.

Giant crabs are nonintelligent animals found in shallow waters, coastal rivers, and buried in sand on beaches. They cannot swim. The common giant crab is 8' in diameter, but larger specimens may be found (up to 6 Hit Dice, Damage 3d6 points per claw).

They are always hungry and will attack and eat anything that moves. Salt-water giant crabs have a slightly different appearance than fresh-water giant crabs.

Its beak attack causes 1d6 points of damage. Any creature bitten or touched by a cockatrice must make a saving throw or be turned to stone. Cockatrices may be found anywhere.

**Plane of Earth:** On the plane of Earth, a cockatrice is a foot-long birdlike creature made of soft earth. It is nearly harmless, able to inflict only 1 point of damage with a beak attack. Its touch can still petrify a creature not made of earth (the saving throw still applies). Cockatrices breed normally on their own plane.

and semitropical swamps and rivers. Sometimes they are seen in underground rivers and seas. Awkward on land, crocodiles do not stray far from water and will spend hours floating just under the surface. At such times, they can be mistaken for logs.

If hungry, these animals will attack creatures in the water. They are particularly attracted to the smell of blood or violent thrashing of the water.

Normal crocodiles grow to 10' or more in length. Large crocodiles are about 20' long and can overturn canoes and small rafts. Giant crocodiles are almost always found in "lost worlds" where prehistoric creatures thrive. They are over 50' long and have been known to attack small ships.

A cyclops (plural: cyclopes) is a rare type of giant, noted for its great size and the single eye in the center of its forehead. A cyclops is about 20' tall. It has poor depth perception because of its single eye, and it strikes with a penalty of -2 on all attack rolls. A cyclops will usually fight with a wooden club. It can throw rocks to a 200' range (60/130/200), each hit causing 3d6 points of damage.

Some cyclopes (5%) are able to cast a *curse* once a week. (The DM should decide the exact nature of the curse.)

A cyclops usually lives alone, though a small group may sometimes share a large cave. They spend their time raising sheep and grapes. Cyclopes are known for their stupidity, and a clever party can often escape from them by trickery.

Other leader types that exist (in the lair, for example) are outlined in the Leader table.

The tail and bite of a normal devilfish of 1-4 Hit Dice each inflict 1 point of damage. However, those of 5 or more Hit Dice have the abilities of vampires as well (see *Vampire*).

These vampire devilfish inflict more damage (1d4/1d6) and a double energy drain with each hit. They can only be harmed by magical or silver weapons (or holy items, as vampires), but can be turned by a cleric, like regular vampires. They can *charm* and regenerate as normal vampires,

but cannot change shape.

Devilfish matriarchs can have 10th to 16th level spell ability. All have 6 Hit Dice, with one asterisk for each two levels of spells used, plus one asterisk for normal-weapon immunity and one for other vampiric abilities. They cannot gain seventh

level spells. It is nearly impossible for characters to tell which devilfish in a group are casting spells, thus, if the PCs defeat the entire group, they get the experience listed in the table as "Entire group."

*Terrain:* Ocean.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

Though not strictly correct in the scientific sense, the game term "dinosaur" applies to any prehistoric bird, fish, mammal, or reptile found in the Mesozoic or Paleozoic eras. Dinosaurs were the ancestors of modern birds, reptiles, and

mammals. All dinosaurs are very stupid (Intelligence 1-3) and easily fooled.

Each dinosaur can be placed in one of three categories: aquatic (mostly marine) dinosaurs, land-based carnivores (meat eaters), and land-based herbivores (plant eaters). Use the general infor-

mation given to create your own dinosaurs. *You* can create your own totally "new" dinosaurs, or base their descriptions on real dinosaurs.

When assigning XP, treat them as having no special abilities unless they can swallow opponents whole (as noted in some descriptions). If you create your own dinosaurs, add an asterisk for each special ability (such as poison, throwing spikes, swoop, exceptional armor, and so on).

Dinosaurs listed elsewhere in this book include: cave bear (bear), giant boar, giant crocodile, mastodon (elephant), pterosaur, sabretooth tiger (cats, great), triceratops, and tyrannosaurus rex.

Most aquatic dinosaurs are fish, turtles, or a combination of the two. Most are omnivorous, eating marine plants and a few small fish or other easy victims. The fins or flippers of any aquatic dinosaur may be used in defense, though this is not a normal attack form (use only if the dinosaur is in a frenzy).

Small aquatic: Only primitive fish and eels fall into this category. Most flee if disturbed by anything 1 foot long or more.

Large aquatic: Some large land herbivores have marine counterparts, similar in appearance except for smaller legs, and fins instead of claws. Some look like snakes with unarmored turtlelike bodies. Only the largest aquatic dinosaurs have high morale. Carnivorous types will be more aggressive and territorial. A very large specimen (20 + HD) may be able to swallow man-sized opponents on an attack roll of 20; treasure may be found inside its body.

Armored aquatic: All the dinosaurs in this category are slow in comparison to other marine life, because of their large shells. They are the ancestors of modern turtles.

*Terrain:* River/Lake, Ocean (prehistoric)

# Chapter 14: Monsters

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

All carnivorous dinosaurs are aggressive, attacking nearly any prey on sight, even attacking other carnivores smaller than themselves.

Small carnivores: These normally attack with bite only, although some of the larger ones might use claws for minimal damage. They commonly hunt in packs. Only the fastest types gain the better armor class (4).

Large carnivores: These types usually attack with both claws and a bite. Many carnivores of 10 Hit Dice or more hold on with their bites, in-

flicting automatic damage each round. The largest may actually swallow prey whole if the attack roll is 20. Treasure might be found in their stomachs or droppings.

Flying carnivores: These dinosaurs have wingspreads of 10 to 60 feet, with body length about 30-40% of the wingspread. With surprise, a flying carnivore might swoop upon prey, inflicting double damage if the attack succeeds. Most flying carnivores flee if harmed, preferring easier prey, unless they are very hungry.

**Terrain:** Any warm climate (prehistoric).

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

Herbivores are usually not aggressive unless armored (see below). However, if surprised or frightened, their actions are often unpredictable. To determine random actions, roll 1d6: 1-2 = attack with tail; 3-4 = run away; 5-6 = charge at intruders. If the dinosaur is damaged, add 1 to the die roll.

When herbivores charge intruders, each victim must make a saving throw vs. death ray to avoid being trampled, if they can't get out of the way in time. This may be required up to twice per charging dinosaur, per victim. A success means no damage is taken; a failure means the trampling damage is automatically taken. No attack roll is made, as herbivores do not actually pursue individuals.

Small herbivores: Many of these stand on their hind legs, and might at a distance seem identical to common carnivorous dinosaurs.

Medium-sized herbivores: Most of these are four-legged browsing dinosaurs, 15 to 30 feet long. Some are amphibious, and will move into nearby water to escape predators.

Armored herbivores: These medium-sized herbivores have developed heavy bony plates for protection. This armor gives them armor class 3 to -3, and sometimes will be studded with spikes or sharp plates. Attackers might, if they successfully hit these types, take damage themselves, ranging from 1d4 to 2d4 points of damage. Some armored herbivores can use 1 or 2 horn attacks, sometimes with a bite as well, to defend themselves.

Large herbivores: These huge creatures often stand in swamp or shallow waters, both to support their vast bulks and to avoid predators. They often have long necks and tails.

**Terrain:** Any warm climate (prehistoric).

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

A displacer beast looks like a large black panther with six legs and a pair of 6' long tentacles growing from its shoulders. It attacks with these tentacles, which have sharp hornlike edges.

A displacer beast's skin bends light rays, so the

creature always appears to be 3' from its actual position. All attackers have a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, and the creature gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws.

If the creature is severely damaged (6 hit points or less remaining), it can use a ferocious bite attack (+2 bonus to attack roll, damage 1d6 points).

Displacer beasts are carnivores; they prey on smaller herd animals in forests and jungles. They sometimes stray into dungeons out of curiosity or because they smell something good within. They only attack PC parties when especially hungry.

Displacer beasts hate and fear blink dogs, and will always attack them and anyone traveling with them. It is suspected that displacer beasts and blink dogs both come from some faraway plane of existence, and are at war with one another throughout the dimensions.

**Terrain:** Hill, Jungle, Woods.

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Rare).

Djinn are intelligent, free-willed, enchanted creatures from the elemental plane of Air. They appear as tall, humanlike beings; 50% of encountered djinn are male and 50% are female. Djinn are basically good-hearted, in spite of their Chaotic alignment.

Djinn are highly magical in nature, and can only be harmed by magic or magical weapons. A djinn can use each of its seven powers three times each day. These powers are:

- Create food and drink (as a 7th level cleric).
- Create metallic objects of up to 1,000 cn weight (of temporary duration, varying by type: gold = 1 day, iron = 1 round).
- Create soft goods and wooden objects of up to 1,000 cn weight (of permanent duration).
- Become invisible.
- Assume gaseous form.
- Form a whirlwind.
- Create illusions (which affect both sight and hearing, lasting until touched or magically dispelled—the djinn need not concentrate to maintain them).

A djinni has two forms of attack. In normal form, it strikes with its fist. It may also transform itself into a whirlwind—a cone 70' tall, 20' diameter at the top, 10' diameter at the base, movement rate 120' (40'). The transformation takes five rounds. The djinni-whirlwind inflicts 2d6 points of damage to all in its path, and sweeps aside all creatures with fewer than 2 HD unless they make a saving throw vs. death ray. If a djinni is slain, its spirit returns to its own plane.

Djinn normally appear on the Prime Plane when summoned or when bound into a magical item. On their own plane, they live in cities similar to those of wealthy human desert cultures. They do not care to be preyed upon and enslaved by magic-users and view them with suspicion.

There can be djinn spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters."

Plane of Air: Additional information applies to djinn encountered on their own plane, the elemental plane of Air.

A djinni on its own plane is immune to normal weapons, all 1st level spells, and to all attacks based on water. A djinni on its own plane can detect invisible at will (120' range).

*Elemental Plane of Air Statistics: AC 3, HD 7 + 1\*, MV 240' (80'), /AT 1 strike or special, D 2-16 or special, NA 1-4 (1-100), SaveF14, ML 9, TTSpecial, AL C, XP 1,025.*

The benevolent djinni empire is noted for its lack of laws. The air elementals and the djinni are generally at peace, though occasional quarrels and rare fights do occur. Their enemies are the haouu and the effet, and they fear earth-type creatures and attacks.

*Terrain:* plane of Air, Desert (preferred).

*Load:* A djinni can fly carrying 3,500 cn of weight at full speed or 7,000 cn of weight at half speed; in times of grave need, it can carry up to 12,000 cn of weight (for 3 turns walking or 1 turn flying) but the djinni must rest for 1 turn afterward.

| XP Value:      | 4,800                       |

*Monster Type:* Planar Monster, Enchanted (Very Rare).

In the elemental plane of Air, the rulers of the djinni are known as pashas. They appear as very large normal djinni. A pasha cannot be affected by normal weapons, or even by weapons of less than +2 enchantment. They regenerate at the rate of 3 points per round.

A pasha can perform all the abilities of a normal djinni (above) as often as desired, up to once per round. It can also enter or leave the Ethereal Plane by concentrating for 1 full round.

They have other special powers, each usable once per day, including:

- Grant another's wish
- Cast cloudkill
- Cast water to gas
- Cast weather control

A pasha's whirlwind form is 120' tall, 40' diameter at the top, 10' diameter at the base, and can move at 240' (80') rate. Unlike normal djinni, it can enter or leave whirlwind form in only 1 round. This form inflicts 3d12 points of damage to all in its path and slays any victim of less than 5 Hit Dice unless the victim makes a saving throw vs. death ray.

Pashas cannot be summoned by spells, and are influenced by very few magical items. They normally appear on the Prime Plane only in response to the cries of a mistreated djinni.

*Terrain:* Normally found only on their own plane; prefer Desert terrains.

*Load:* 10,000 cn flying at full speed; 20,000 cn flying at half speed; or double this when walking.

### Dolphin

| Armour Class:  | 5           |

*Monster Type:* Normal Animal (Common).

Dolphins are seagoing mammals; their favorite food is fish. They are related to whales, but are much smaller. They are 10' long with a smooth hide. Dolphins cannot breathe water and must come to the surface once every 15 minutes for air.

Dolphins are intelligent and have their own high-pitched language. They can communicate telepathically with other dolphins within 50 miles, and they can *detect magic* underwater (360' range).

Dolphins hate sharks and occasionally attack them. Dolphins are the friends of most sailors and have been known to help people in trouble. Mermen sometimes ride dolphins as steeds; fantastic sea-beings may even harness them to chariots.

*Terrain:* Ocean.

*Load:* 1,500 cn at full speed; 3,000 cn at half speed.

### Doppleganger

| Armour Class:  | 5         |
|----------------|-----------|
| Hit Dice:      | 4* (M)    |
| Move:          | 90' (30') |
| Attacks:       | 1 bite    |
| Damage:        | 1d12      |
| No. Appearing: | 1d6 (1d6) |
| Save As:       | F8        |
| Morale:        | 8         |
| Treasure Type: | E         |
| Intelligence:  | 9         |
| Alignment:     | Chaotic   |
| XP Value:      | 125       |

*Monster Type:* Monster (Rare).

These man-sized shape-changing creatures are intelligent and evil. A doppleganger is able to shape itself into the exact form of any human, demihuman, or humanoid creature it sees (up to 7' tall). Once in the form of the person it is imitating, it attacks that person, intending to kill him and assume his identity. Its favorite trick is to kill the original person in some way without alerting the party. Then, in the role of that individual, it attacks others by surprise, often when they are already engaged in combat.

*Sleep and charm* spells do not affect dopplegangers and they make all saving throws as 8th level fighters due to their highly magical nature. When killed, a doppleganger turns back into its original form, a skinny, hairless, genderless humanoid with pale, rubbery skin.

It is believed the doppleganger establishes a limited telepathic link with an intended victim (only). It quickly learns everything the victim knows (even to the point of answering detailed questions at the same time—or sooner—than the victim, should both be present). However, a doppleganger cannot use spells memorized by a spellcasting victim.

Doppleganger spellcasters are extremely rare, but not unknown. Such spellcasters can use their own spells in any humanoid form; see "Monster Spellcasters."

*Terrain:* Any.

**Monster Type:** Dragon (Rare).

Dragons are a very old race of huge winged lizards. They like to live in isolated, out-of-the-way places where few men are found. Dragons are extremely powerful monsters and should be used with caution when encountered by low level player characters. It is recommended that until characters reach 4th level and higher that only the youngest and smallest dragons be used.

There are several types of dragon, distinguishable by the colors of their hides: white, black, green, blue, red, and gold. Though the colors of their scaly hides make dragons look different, they all have quite a few things in common: they are all hatched from eggs, all are carnivores, all have breath weapons. Dragons have a great love of treasure, but they value their own lives more. Dragons in battle will do everything possible to save their own lives, including surrender.

Many dragons live hundreds or thousands of years. Because of their long history, they tend to think less of the younger races (such as Man). Chaotic dragons might capture men, but will usually kill and eat them immediately. Neutral dragons might either attack or ignore a party completely. Lawful dragons, however, may actually help a party if the characters are truly worthy of this great honor. When playing a dragon, a DM should keep in mind that, because of its pride, even the hungriest dragon will pause and listen to flattery (if no one is attacking it, and if it understands the language of the speaker).

**Talking Dragons:** Dragons are intelligent, and some dragons can speak the Dragon and Common tongues. The percentage listed under

![A black and white illustration of a large dragon attacking a group of defeated soldiers and skeletons. A warrior in armor and a shield stands in the foreground, facing the dragon.]()![](_page_168_Picture_11.jpeg)

# Chapter 14: Monsters

"Chance of Talking" is the chance that a dragon will be able to talk. Talking dragons are also able to use magical (but not clerical) spells. The number of spells and their levels are given in the table. Dragon spells are usually selected randomly. Wherever applicable, treat the Hit Dice of the dragon as the level of caster for spell-like effects (for purposes of duration, dispelling, etc.).

**Sleeping Dragons:** The percentage chance given under "Chance of Being Asleep" applies whenever a party encounters a dragon on the ground (flying dragons are never asleep). Any result greater than the percentage means that the dragon is not asleep (though it may be pretending to be!). If a dragon is asleep, it may be attacked for one round (with a bonus of +2 on all attack rolls), during which it will awaken. Combat is handled normally for the second and subsequent rounds.

**Gold Dragons:** Gold dragons always talk and use spells. They can also change their shape, and often appear in the form of a human or animal. Gold dragons can breathe either fire (like a red dragon) or chlorine gas (like a green dragon), though they still have a total of three breath weapon attacks per day (nor six). The type of breath used should be chosen by the DM to fit the situation.

## Breath Weapons

All dragons have a special attack called their "breath weapon." Any dragon can use its breath weapon up to three times each day. A dragon's first attack is almost always with its breath weapon. The number of points of damage the breath weapon does is equal to the dragon's current number of hit points. Any damage done to a dragon will reduce the damage it can do with its breath weapon.

After the first breath attack, and until it has used up all three breaths for the day, a dragon might choose either to breathe or attack with its natural weapons. To determine this randomly (small dragons only), roll 1d6: on a roll of 1-3 the dragon will use its claw and bite attacks; on a roll of 4-6 the dragon will breathe again.

Large and huge dragons use breath weapons intelligently, not randomly. They rarely aim at single opponents, and normally save the attack for use against groups. The volume of the breath weapon increases with the size of the dragon; the breath sizes are given in the tables above.

**Shape of Breath:** A dragon's breath weapon appears as one of three different shapes: cone-shaped, a straight line, or a cloud of gas.

A cone-shaped breath begins at the dragon's mouth (where it is 2" wide) and spreads out until it reaches its widest point at its furthest end. For example, the area of effect of a small white dragon's breath is a cone 80' long and 30' wide at its far end.

A line-shaped breath starts in the dragon's mouth and stretches out toward its victim in a straight line (even downward). Even at its source, a line-shaped breath is 5' wide.

A cloud-shaped breath billows forth from the dragon's mouth to form a cloud. On the table, three dimensions are shown: The first is the width, the second is the depth, and the third is the height. Therefore, with a small green dragon, you get a cloud that's 50' wide, 40' deep (i.e., it reaches up to 40' away from the dragon),

and 30' tall, around the dragon's targets directly in front of it.

**Saving Throws:** Each victim within a dragon's breath must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon (even if the breath is similar to another type of attack). If successful, the victim takes only half damage from the breath.

Breath weapons are not spells and cannot be turned or absorbed by devices or other protective spell effects except those that specifically mention dragon breath.

Dragons are immune to the effects of their own breath weapon type. Further, they automatically make their saving throws against any attack form that is the same as their breath weapon. For example, a red dragon suffers no damage from (and usually ignores) flaming oil, and suffers only one-half damage from a *fireball* spell.

## Physical Attacks

**Attack Bonuses:** Small dragons attack as monsters of their listed Hit Dice. Large dragons gain a +2 bonus to all attack rolls. Huge dragons gain a +4 bonus to all attack rolls.

**Types of Physical Attacks:** Dragons usually make two claw attacks and one bite attack; at the DM's option they can use other special attack forms (kick, tail, wing) defined later.

When a flying dragon attacks an aerial target, it gets two claw attacks and one bite attack, but cannot use wing, kick or tail attacks. When attacking a ground-level victim from the air, a dragon can use one Crush, Hover, or Swoop attack (as described below), but no two in combination.

If a dragon attacks while on the ground, it can substitute a wing, kick or a tail attack for any of its normal attacks, so long as it makes only three attacks in the round. (For example, the dragon might bite one target, kick another, and sweep its tail across a third instead of using two claws and one bite.)

**Crush:** This maneuver is often used if the dragon surprises nonhuman victims, or possibly against any opponents if the dragon is seriously wounded. When crushing, the dragon actually lands on its victims. Each may make a saving throw vs. death ray; success indicates complete evasion of the crush, and no damage is inflicted. A victim may choose to remain in the area, taking the full damage of the crush; if he holds a weapon in hand, he may make an attack roll with a +4 bonus. If he hits, he inflicts double damage.

A small dragon can crush one victim only. A large dragon can crush all in a 10' radius circle. A huge dragon can crush all in a 20' radius circle.

**Hover:** When using this attack form, the dragon pauses in flight directly above its targets, its wings beating furiously. The dragon may attack up to six opponents in one round while hovering, using 1 bite, 2 front claws, 2 rear kicks, and 1 tail (but no wing attacks). A breath weapon cannot be used while hovering, because of the wind from the wings.

After 1 round of hover attacks, the dragon must land immediately, but the dragon cannot crush after hovering. (Note that the location of opponents might prevent the use of some attack forms.)

**Swoop:** This special ability is mentioned at the start of this chapter; in addition the dragon may

pick up one or more victims if its attack rolls are high enough (see table).

When a dragon swoops, its victims suffer a —1 penalty to their surprise roll, because of the creature's silent glide. If the dragon surprises the victim, each hit inflicts double damage.

|       | Attack Roll | Swoop Attack     |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Size  | Needed      | Forms            |
| Small | 20          | 1 claw           |
| Large | 18-20       | 2 claws          |
| Huge  | 16-20       | 2 claws + 1 bite |

A victim caught by a swoop can attack the dragon, but with a -2 penalty to all attack rolls, and each hit inflicts only minimum damage.

A victim held in a claw automatically takes normal claw damage each round, but if the victim wins initiative, he may act first (cast a spell, use a device, etc.).

A victim held in a bite automatically takes normal bite damage each round, and cannot concentrate (regardless of initiative). When the victim is dead he is swallowed. A dragon can bite a victim held in a claw, but with a -2 penalty to the attack roll. If successful, the victim is transferred to the mouth.

## Other Attacks

These are elements of the hover attack or optional ground attacks, including those outlined in the following paragraphs.

**Kick:** Any victim hit by a kick attack must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be knocked over. A penalty applies to the saving throw, equal to the amount of damage inflicted. Any victim knocked over can get up during the next round, but will automatically lose initiative.

**Tail:** Any victim hit by the tail attack of a large or huge dragon must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be knocked over (as with a kick) and is disarmed. A penalty applies to the saving throw, equal to the damage inflicted. A disarmed opponent can spend one round picking up the weapon, or can switch weapons, merely losing initiative.

**Wing:** A wing attack can be used against any opponent within range—which is great. The range is 3' per Hit Die of the dragon. Any victim hit by a wing attack must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be stunned. A penalty applies to the saving throw, equal to the damage inflicted.

## Dragon Tactics

**Small dragons** normally attack with claws and bite when on the ground, without using kicks or tail attacks. Their legs are too short for effective kicking unless an opponent is close behind them. They are not proficient in attacking with the tail (though it may be used to inflict damage only, at the DM's choice). If its swoop attack hits, a small dragon can pick up one man-sized opponent.

**Large dragons** use all attacks except wings. Kick attacks can be used against any opponents within 10' of the body. A tail attack can be aimed at any opponent to the rear or sides. If its swoop attack hits, a large dragon can pick up one or two man-sized opponents, or one horse-sized creature.

**Huge dragons** use all attacks effectively against any opponent within melee range,

through maneuvering. Wing attacks can be aimed at any opponents to the sides, or, if more than one opponent is in front of the dragon, against those on either side. If its swoop attack hits, a huge dragon can pick up one, two, or three man-sized victims, or two horse-sized, or one giant-sized opponent.

### Subduing Dragons

Whenever characters encounter a dragon, they may choose to try to subdue it rather than kill it. To subdue a dragon, all attacks must be with the "flat of the sword." Thus, missile weapons and spells cannot be used to subdue. Attacks and damage are determined normally, but this "subduing damage" is not real damage. The dragon will fight normally until it reaches 0 or less hit points, at which time it will surrender. The subduing damage does not reduce the damage done by the dragon's breath weapon.

A dragon may be subdued because it realizes that its attackers could have killed it if they had been striking to kill. It therefore surrenders, admitting that the opponents have won the battle.

A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or turn on its captor if given a reasonable chance to do so through the party's actions. For example, a dragon left unguarded at night, or who is ordered to guard a position alone, would consider these "reasonable chances." A subdued dragon can be sold. The price is up to the DM, but should never exceed 1,000 gp per hit point.

The dragon may be forced to serve the characters who subdued it. If a subdued dragon is ever ordered to perform a task which is apparently suicidal, the dragon will attempt to escape, and may try to kill its captors in the process.

### Final Details

**Age:** The statistics given above are for average dragons of each type. "Younger dragons are smaller and have acquired less treasure; older dragons are larger and have acquired more. Age will cause a dragon to vary in Hit Dice from 3 HD smaller (younger) to 3 HD larger (older) than average. For example, a small red dragon could have from 7 to 13 Hit Dice, depending on its age.

**Treasure:** "Younger dragons may have as little as 1/4 to 1/2 the listed treasure; older dragons may have as much as double the listed amount. Dragon treasure is found only in a dragon's lair. These lairs are rarely left unguarded, and are well-hidden to prevent easy discovery.

**Terrain:** Each type of dragon prefers a specific type of terrain. White: Cold regions. Black: Swamp, Marsh. Green: Jungle, Woods. Blue: Desert, Open. Red: Mountain, Hill. Gold: Any.

**Loud:** A dragon can move at its full speed when carrying 1000 cn times its Hit Dice; or half speed when carrying 2,000 cn times its Hit Dice.

**Barding Multiplier:** This varies, depending on size. Small Dragon x 3, Large Dragon x 5 Huge Dragon x 10.

Unless otherwise noted, the gemstone dragons are similar to the standard dragons, including the details of preferred terrain, attacks, size, age, treasure, etc. For XP value, add an asterisk for every two spell levels available to the dragon.

At 120 or greater range, each of the "gemstone" dragons appears identical to that of the corresponding normal color (i.e., crystal to white, onyx to black, jade to green, sapphire to blue, ruby to red, amber to gold). At closer ranges (within 30"), the shimmering color differences can be easily distinguished by the trained eye.

The new breath weapons are summarized for each dragon.

**Crystal (crystal):** A victim who fails the saving throw takes full damage, and all his nonliving carried items turn to crystal. If the victim makes his saving throw, the victim takes only half damage and his items are unaffected. Any weapon, tooth or claw turned to crystal can be used to attack, but will probably (1-5 on 1d6) shatter if a hit is scored. If the weapon shatters, it inflicts the minimum possible damage for that blow, and is destroyed. A *stone to flesh* spell (in modified form) can be used to permanently turn up to 100 cubic feet of crystal items (easily including all items normally carried by 1-3 persons) back to their normal forms.

**Onyx (darkness):** A victim who fails his saving throw takes full damage, and a *darkness spell effect* (15" radius) appears centered on the victim, moving as he moves. It can be countered by a *light spell*, or removed by *dispel magic*; otherwise it remains for 1 round per Hit Die of the dragon. This *darkness* is a special type through which the dragon can easily see; if otherwise functions exactly as a normal *darkness* spell. If the saving throw is successful, the victim takes only half damage.

**Jade (disease):** A victim who fails his saving throw takes full damage, and he and all items carried become infected with a rotting disease.

This disease causes all nonmetal items to rot away in 1d6 turns unless a *curse disease* spell is cast on them during that time. A victim cannot be affected by any healing spells, nor healing item, save a *curse disease* effect. The disease also inflicts 1 point of damage per turn (but not cumulative in the case of multiple failed saving throws). If the saving throw is successful, the victim takes only half damage and avoids the disease.

**Sapphire (vaporize):** A victim who fails the saving throw takes full damage, and he and all items carried are turned into gaseous form for one turn per Hit Die of the dragon. Vaporized creatures and items are invisible and unable to make any noise or affect any solid item. The victim can move at up to a 60' (20') rate by concentrating. A *dispel magic* effect can restore the victim and items to normal form; treat the level of magic as equal to the dragon's Hit Dice. Vaporized creatures are immune to most attacks (such as lightning, fire, etc.).

**Ruby (fire and melt):** A victim who fails his saving throw takes full damage, and all items carried start to burn or melt (no saving throw). Paper items are destroyed instantly; leather items in 1 round; all other nonmetal items in 2 rounds; nonmagical metal items in 3 rounds; and magical items of all sorts in 4 or more rounds. If the item has a bonus ("pluses"), add 1 round to the 4-round period for each point. Items that give immunity or resistance to fire also melt, but in double the normal time. The burning or melting items may be saved if immersed in water (or otherwise cooled, such as magically) before they are destroyed. The DM may choose to deduct 1 or more "pluses" from partially damaged items. If the saving throw is successful, the victim takes only half damage.

**Amber (chlorine gas and disease, fire and melt):** See notes for the jade dragon (disease) and ruby dragon (fire and melt).

**Monster Type:** Dragon, Planar Monster (Very Rare).

Each of the three Dragon Rulers is the leader of all dragons with the same alignment. These three rulers, in turn, obey the Great One, ruler of all dragons.

**Pearl:** Rules Chaotic Dragons (Black, Green, Red and Amber)

**Opal:** Rules Neutral Dragons (White, Onyx, Jade and Blue)

**Diamond:** Rules Lawful Dragons (Crystal, Sapphire, Ruby and Gold)

These creatures are extremely rare, almost never appearing on the Prime Plane unless there is great need. They are all Immortal. If a dragon ruler's material body is slain, the spirit goes to its home plane (one of the outer planes) and creates a new body.

Each of these dragons is bigger than the biggest gold or amber dragon; in natural form, each is over 100' long.

Pearl, ruler of Chaotic dragons, has scales like mother-of-pearl—white but iridescent, constantly shifting, like her Chaotic nature.

Opal, ruler of Neutral dragons, has scales which are white with thousands of tiny specks of color in all the hues of the rainbow.

Diamond, ruler of Lawful dragons, has scales with the refractive qualities of faceted diamond: They glitter and gleam with so much reflected light that it is hard to stare at this dragon.

The Great One has scales which glow brightly, like the surface of a white sun; no one can stare directly at him except through a darkness spell effect (through which he looks like an enormous three-headed white dragon).

Each ruler is always attended by four of his or her largest, most powerful followers. Pearl is always accompanied by four huge amber dragons, each with 176 hit points. Opal is always with four blue dragons, each with 144 hit points. Diamond is always with four gold dragons, each with 176 hit points. The Great One has a retinue

of twelve dragons: four gold, four amber, and four blue, all sufficiently dedicated to serving the Great One that they do not get into fights based on alignment differences. All of these attendants can use spells.

When traveling, the dragon rulers usually bring one of each type of their largest subjects; for example, when on an excursion to the Prime Plane, Diamond brings one ruby dragon (160 hit points), one sapphire dragon (144 hit points), and one crystal dragon (96 hit points), in addition to the usual four gold dragons (176 hit points each).

All dragon rulers are immune to charm, hold, paralysis, slow, death ray, disintegration, and poison. Dragon rulers cannot be subdued or tamed like some lesser dragons.

The three lesser rulers are immune to normal and silvered weapons, to all spells of 6th level or less, and to all weapons of less than +3 enchantment. The Great One is immune to normal and silvered weapons, clerical/druidic spells of 6th level or less and magical spells of 8th level or less, and weapons of less than +4 enchantment.

All dragon rulers are immune to all dragon breath weapons and are unaffected by dragon control magical items.

A dragon ruler can polymorph itself at will into the form of any of its follower dragons. Each ruler has a spell book containing all of the known spells, but must study and learn them just as a normal magic-user. Clerical spells are gained with the usual amount of meditation.

Each dragon ruler can use any breath weapon of its followers, each once per day, and while in either normal or polymorphed (to a lesser dragon) form. For example, Opal can breathe a cone of cold (as a white), line of acid-and-darkness (as an onyx), cloud of gas-and-disease (as a jade), or a lightning bolt (as a blue), for a total of four breaths per day. Each dragon ruler can attack up to nine times per round (with two bites, two claws, two wings, two kicks, and two tail).

The Great One can use any breath weapon of any dragon, each once per day, and while in either normal or polymorphed form. He has up to 10 attacks, using the tail twice.

The lair treasures of the dragon rulers always include at least three miscellaneous magical items usable by dragons; these items may be used against invaders, as appropriate. The Great One, in addition, owns one artifact. (The specific artifact is the DM's choice, but the artifact is not ultimately fatal to the dragon ruler, nor does it involve undead in any way.)

The Dragon Rulers act as leaders for all dragon-kind. They arbitrate disputes between clans of dragons and occasionally—very occasionally—act on the behalf of lesser dragons against other species. They do not intercede when a party of heroes destroys a rogue dragon, but will act when a clan of dragons faces extinction or enslavement.

The three lesser rulers of dragonkind do not like or cooperate with each other, but neither do they fight each other. The Great One treats them equally, without a favorite. The origins of the rulers are unknown, but the lesser rulers may be the offspring of The Great One.

**Monster Type:** Dragon-Kin (Rare).

Dragon turtles are a magical crossbreed of a dragon and a giant turtle. They have the head, limbs, and tail of a great dragon and the hard shell of a turtle. Dragon turtles are so large that sailors have landed on ones floating on the surface, mistaking them for small islands. These creatures usually live in the depths of great oceans and seas, seldom surfacing or approaching land.

The dragon turtle is able to use a breath weapon just like a dragon. It can breathe a cloud of steam 50' long and 40' wide. This breath weapon does damage like a dragon's breath weapon, inflicting hit points of damage equal to the current hit points of the dragon turtle.

Dragon turtles live in great caverns on the bottom of the deepest oceans, where they keep the treasures of sunken ships. On occasion, they will rise under ships, attempting to overturn them and devour the occupants.

**Note:** Dragon turtles are extremely powerful creatures that should not be used unless the player characters are of very high level.

**Terrain:** Ocean.

**Monster Type:** Dragon-Kin (Rare).

Elemental Drakes: Dragon-Kin, Planar Monster, Enchanted (Rare).

A drake is a man-sized creature that looks much like a dragon in its normal form. However, it is most often encountered *polymorphed* into a human or demihuman form. Drakes have no breath weapons or spellcasting abilities, but they can talk. They may be evil or good (50% chance of each) but, except for Elemental forms, are always very Chaotic. Drakes are extremely intelligent and clever; they tell lies as needed, and surrender rather than fight to the death.

Drakes are immune to all spells of 4th level or less, but may cancel this immunity for 1 round by concentrating—to receive the benefits of a *curse wounds* spell, for example.

In normal form, a drake looks similar to a small dragon without front legs and with tiny wings. These wings can only support slow flight, and only for an hour at a time. All drakes can *polymorph* themselves into humanoid form (and back) as often as desired. In human or demihuman form, a drake can use any weapon permitted to thieves. The attacks and damage given above apply to normal (dragon-kin) form only.

All drakes are thieves, having all the special abilities of a 5th level thief. Some mandrakes may actually join *Thieves'* Guilds and improve their abilities, though most avoid such lawfulness. They are fond of pranks and tricks, and sometimes act as agents for evil powers. A protection from evil spell blocks drakes.

**Mandrake:** These tan drakes can change into human form, and they enjoy the company of men. They often hold minor jobs in stables and taverns in towns (never in positions of importance or power), and may pretend to be adventurers. They often steal food from town storehouses, and valuables from wandering

townsfolk.

**Wooddrake:** These dark green drakes can change themselves into elf or halfling forms. They are otherwise very similar in habits to mandrakes, and are sometimes discovered amidst eleven or halfling communities.

**Colddrake:** These white drakes shun the light of day, living deep underground (usually in icy caverns). They can change themselves into dwarf or gnome forms, and can sometimes be found amidst an underground dwarf or gnome community.

**Elemental Drake:** There are four types: air-drakes (blue), earthdrakes (brown), firedrakes (red), and waterdrakes (sea-green). They have the same immunities as all drakes. Elemental drakes are also immune to normal and silver weapons; a magical weapon is needed to damage them. They live on the elemental planes, and are very rare on the Prime Plane. They cannot normally travel between the planes, but may "ride" along with an elemental or other creature, either to or from their plane of origin.

On the Prime Plane, elemental drakes can take the forms of young giants (1-4 feet shorter than normal), but they cannot throw rocks in those forms, and can only inflict 2d6 points of damage in hand-to-hand combat (instead of the normal damage done by the giant form). An airdrake can assume the form of a cloud giant; an earthdrake, a stone giant; a firedrake, a fire giant; and a waterdrake, a storm giant. They are sometimes found amidst similar real giants, acting for their own purposes.

On their home planes, elemental drakes cannot change into giant forms; instead, they assume the form of a small elemental, with all the abilities of that form (treat each as a 6 Hit Dice elemental in size and ability).

**Terrain:** Any.

### Drolem\*

| Alignment:     | Neutral             |
| XP Value:      | 11,375              |

**Monster Type:** Construct, Enchanted (Very Rare).

A drolem is a type of golem that looks like a dragon; it can be made to look like a dragon of any color, or may simply be a dragon skeleton. Like other golems, it is not alive, but a construct made by a high level magic-user or cleric. Drolems are extremely rare, made and used only to guard a special item or area. A special book and several rare materials are needed to make a drolem.

A drolem is nonintelligent, and obeys its instructions exactly. It can see invisible things within 60', and is immune to *charm, hold, sleep*, and all other mind-affecting spells, all forms of fire and cold, and all gases. It is also immune to all spells of 4th level or less, to normal and silver weapons, and even magical weapons of +2 or lesser enchantment.

The drolem's claws inflict 2d6 points of damage each, and its huge jaws cause 11-30 (1d20+10) points of damage. A drolem can also breathe three times per day. Its breath is a small poisonous cloud, 20' x 20' x 20'; all within it must make a saving throw vs. dragon breath or die.

**Terrain:** Any.

**Load:** 20,000 cn at full speed; 40,000 cn at up to half speed.

## Dryad

| Alignment:     | Neutral        |
| XP Value:      | 25             |

**Monster Type:** Humanoid (Rare).

Dryads are beautiful female tree spirits who live in trees, in woodland settings or dense forests. They are very shy and nonviolent, but very suspicious of strangers. If a dryad wishes to be unobserved, she will join with her tree, becoming pan of it.

Dryads possess a powerful *charm person* ability—it is just like the magical spell, but the dryad can use it any number of times per day, and its victims save at a -2 penalty. Dryads only use this power on people following or attacking them or on males to whom they are attracted—and even then will only use the power on men who do not return their affection.

Dryads will send *charmed* attackers off to a deadly monster's lair or ambush where the attackers may be slain; they draw objects of affection into their trees and keep them. Unless rescued immediately, such victims will never be seen again (or, at the DM's option, will reappear after a few years, remembering little of the time they were gone). Characters can rescue the victim by threatening to destroy the dryad's tree; a dryad will release a *charmed* victim rather than see her tree die.

A dryad will die if her tree dies, and can only survive for 1 turn if taken more than 240' away from it. She hides her treasure in hollows under her tree's roots.

Most dryads rarely carry weapons, but a dryad defending her tree or helping an actaon may pick up a javelin or spear.

There can be dryad spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters."

**Terrain:** Woods (dense).

## Dwarf

| Armor Class:   | 4                   |

| Alignment:     | Lawful or Neutral   |
| XP Value:      | 10                  |

**Monster Type:** Demihuman (Common).

Dwarves can appear as NPCs. Otherwise, they are usually met in clan groups or as war or mining expeditions. They attack as first level fighters. For every 20 dwarves, there will be one leader (level 3-8) who may have a magical weap-

on. (To check for possible magical items, multiply the leader's level by 5. The result is the percent chance for that leader to own a magical item from any one particular subtable. Roll separately for each type (subtable) of magical treasure. Check all subtables except the Scroll suitable and the Wand/Rod/Staff subtable.) As long as their leader is alive and fighting with them, dwarven morale is 10 rather than 8. Dwarves hate goblins and will usually attack them on sight.

**Terrain:** Hill, Mountain.

## Efreeti, Lesser\*

| Intelligence:  | 14         |
| Alignment:     | Chaotic    |
| XP Value:      | 1,750      |

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Rare).

Efreeti are free-willed, enchanted creatures from the elemental plane of Fire. They usually appear as clouds of smoke, condensing into giant-sized men surrounded by flames. The air around them is always hot and smoky. Efreeti are highly magical, and can only be hit with magical weapons. If slain, the efreeti's spirit returns to its own plane.

An efreeti can *create objects*, *create illusions*, and turn *invisible* like a djinni. It can cast a *wall of fire* spell three times per day. An efreeti may also transform itself into a *pillar of flame* (the same height as the efreeti) that will set fire to all flammable items within 5'. It can retain the flame shape for up to 3 rounds. When in this form, the fire adds 1d8 points of damage to each of the efreeti's blows. The creature can only assume flame shape once per turn at most.

An efreeti may be summoned by a high level magic-user (if the special spells required are known—the magic-user must cast both *create magical monsters* to summon the efreeti and *wish* to bind it to the magic-user's service for as long as possible). Once summoned, the efreeti can be forced to serve for 101 days. It is a reluctant and difficult servant, and will obey its exact instructions while attempting to distort their meaning (to cause trouble for its master).

On their own plane, efreeti live in cities similar to those of wealthy human desert-dwellers. Among all creatures, efreeti are most similar to djinni, but they are of opposed elements, so efreeti hate djinni and will attack them on sight.

**Plane of Fire:** The following details apply to efreeti encountered on their own plane, the elemental plane of Fire.

An efreeti on its own plane is immune to normal weapons, all 1st level spells, and to all attacks based on earth. On its own plane, an efreeti can *detect invisible* at will (120' range).

**Elemental Plane of Fire Statistics:** AC 1, HD 10\* (L), MV 240' (80'), # AT 1 strike or special, D 2-16 or special, NA 1-4 (1-100), Save F15, ML8, TTSpecial, AL C, XP 1,750.

Efreeti are irritable and often evil. The fire elements and the efreeti are generally at peace, though the efreeti pick fights and have been at war with the elements in the past. Their enemies are the helions and the djinni, and they fear water-type creatures and attacks.

There can be efreeti spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

**Terrain:** Plane of Fire.

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Very Rare).

In the elemental plane of Fire, the rulers of the efreeti are known as amirs (ah-MEERS). They appear as very large normal efreeti (15'-30' tall). An amir cannot be affected by normal weapons, or even by weapons of less than +2 enchantment. Amirs also regenerate at the rate of 2 hit points per round.

An amir can perform all the abilities of a normal efreeti as often as desired, once per round. It can also enter or leave the Ethereal Plane by concentrating for 1 full round.

Special powers usable once per day are grant another's *wish*, cast *fireball* or *explosive cloud* (all as if a 20th level magic-user).

An amir's *pillar of flame* form ignites all flammable objects within 15' and adds a bonus of 2d8 points to each fist attack. It can retain this shape without limit.

Amirs cannot be summoned by spells, and are affected by very few magical items. They normally appear on the Prime Plane only in response to the cries of a mistreated efreeti. When they appear on the Prime Plane, they can appear anywhere, but prefer warmer climates, such as deserts.

**Terrain:** Plane of Fire.

**Load:** Fly with 10,000 cn at up to full speed; 20,000 cn at up to half speed. Walk with 20,000 cn at up to full speed; 40,000 cn at up to half speed.

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Common).

An elemental is a magical, enchanted creature that lives on another plane of existence (one of the elemental planes). It can be harmed only by magic or magical weapons.

**Staff Elementals** (the weakest) are summoned by a magic-user with a special staff.

**Device Elementals** are summoned with the

use of a special miscellaneous magical item.

**Conjured Elementals** are summoned by the casting of the 5th level magic-user spell.

To summon an elemental, a character must have a large amount of the element nearby (such as open air, bare earth, a pool of water or a bonfire). When the elemental arrives, it is hostile, and must be controlled by concentration at all times. The summoner's concentration is broken if he takes damage or fails any saving throw. The summoner can move only up to half normal speed while concentrating.

If the summoner's concentration is broken, the elemental will attack him. Once lost, control cannot be regained. The elemental can attack any creature between it and its summoner if it desires.

If summoned in an area too small for it (see size notes below), an elemental will fill the available area—sideways, for example—possibly damaging the summoner in the process (and thus breaking the summoner's concentration).

However, an elemental cannot pass a **protection from evil** spell effect.

An elemental will vanish if it or its summoner is slain, or when the summoner sends it back to its plane (which requires control), or if a **dispel magic** is cast upon it.

An **air elemental** appears as a great whirlwind, 2' tall and 1/2" in diameter for each Hit Die (a staff elemental would be 16' tall and 4' across). In combat, all victims of 2 HD or less hit by the whirlwind must make a saving throw vs. death ray or be swept away. The elemental inflicts an extra 1d8 points of damage against any flying opponent.

An **earth elemental** appears as a huge manlike figure, 1' tall for each Hit Die (a spell-conjured elemental would be 16' tall). It cannot cross a water barrier wider than its height. It inflicts an extra 1d8 points of damage against any opponent standing on the ground.

A **fire elemental** appears as a swirling pillar of roaring flame, 1' tall and 1' in diameter for each

### Elemental Defenses and Vulnerabilities

\* When double damage is indicated, the elemental may make a saving throw vs. spells to take normal damage.

\*\* Minimal damage is 1 hit point per die of damage.

# Chapter 14: Monsters

Hit Die (a device elemental would be 12' tall and 12' across). It cannot cross a water barrier wider than its own diameter. It inflicts an extra 1d8 points of damage against any creature with cold-based abilities.

A *water elemental* appears as a great wave of water, 1/2' tall and 2' in diameter for each Hit Die (a staff elemental is 4' tall and 16' across). It is not able to move more than 60' from water. It inflicts an extra 1d8 points of damage against any opponent in water.

An elemental takes double, normal, or minimal damage from certain attack forms.

Terrain: Any.

**Load:** 500 cn x HD at up to full speed, or 1,000 cn x HD at up to half speed. Some protections may be needed (for example, against the heat of a fire elemental).

The statistics above apply only to elements encountered on their own planes of existence. On the Prime Plane, their abilities are very limited. One asterisk (for XP calculation) applies only to elements encountered on their own planes.

Elementals are the dominant life forms on the elemental planes, and refer to themselves as "people." Size may range from 1 to 32 Hit Dice, and the rulers are much larger (50 Hit Dice at least, and possibly over 100).

Their system of rule is similar to that of human Dominions.

An elemental's normal form is a bloblike shape. It can create "arms" as needed, to a maximum of 1 per Hit Die, but can only attack with one blow per round. The elemental's material form is held together by its life force. The youn-

ger the elemental, the less material it can hold together. Thus, aging effects can change an elemental's size. Its normal life span is 30 to 35 Hit Dice.

Small elementals are created when a large elemental splits itself. When this occurs, the "parent" elemental divides into a number of parts equal to its Hit Dice; each new elemental has 1 Hit Die. This does not occur frequently, and the elementals are very secretive about the details of the process.

Elementals usually distrust creatures from the Prime Plane (—1 penalty to all reaction rolls). They can recognize such visitors by smell. However, when visitors appear in elemental form, they do appreciate the effort (+1 bonus to reaction rolls, instead of -1 penalty). In any event, they will not normally attack nor help visitors except in special circumstances. Though most are of Neutral alignment, Lawful (ruling) and Chaotic (renegade) elementals do exist. Some are even good or evil.

Elementals live in towns and cities on their own worlds. Both the worlds and the building materials are made entirely of pure elemental material, in solid, liquid, or gaseous form. In the universe of its own plane, each elemental race occupies thousands of worlds.

The elemental races are far older than human-kind, and more civilized in many ways. They have art forms for six senses.

Some elementals become clerics or magicians in much the same ways as humans. However, an elemental must be an adult of 9 or more Hit Dice before this knowledge can be learned. Many of the spells of the elementals are entirely different, and some cannot be cast by humans except when in elemental form.

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Very Rare).

These slow, huge creatures are identical to normal elementals, but far larger. They are 2' tall per Hit Die. The number appearing applies per plane. Elemental rulers are immune to 1st through 5th level spells, poison, all charm, hold, and other mental attacks, illusions of all types, and any spell which could cause instant death (such as *disintegrate*). Weapons of +3 or less en-

chantment have no effect on them.

Any victim hit by an elemental ruler must make a saving throw vs. death ray or be crushed by the blow, instantly slain regardless of damage. Most of the victim's items and equipment are also destroyed by the blow (95% chance per item, —5% per "plus" if magical). However, any elemental struck by a ruler is not slain, but shattered into several small elementals of 1 Hit Die each (the number of parts equal to half the original Hit Dice).

All elemental rulers are friendly with and can summon most creatures of their respective planes. The creatures summoned will arrive as quickly as possible (usually from 3 rounds to 3 turns).

The "Special" treasures of elemental rulers are similar to those of human rulers, but unique to their respective planes.

**Monster Type:** Elephant: Normal Animal (Rare). Prehistoric: Prehistoric Animal (Very Rare).

Elephants are large, ponderous four-legged mammals. Though they are herbivores, they are very dangerous creatures when frightened or when defending their young. These mighty creatures dwell at the edges of sub-tropical forests, living in medium to large herds. Both males and females have tusks, which are valued at 100-600 gp per tusk for the ivory.

In combat, elephants attack with a charge, if possible, for double tusk damage. In the following rounds of combat they will either strike with their tusks (75%) or trample (25%). Elephants can be used as draft and riding animals. Sometimes they are equipped with barding and used as war-mounts.

Prehistoric (Mastodon): This creature is a large, shaggy elephant. It has two mighty tusks that slope downward and then curve up and backward toward the elephant; they are a mighty battering weapon. Each tusk is worth 200-800 gp. Mastodons live in cold, icy lands or "lost worlds."

**Terrain:** Modern Elephants: Open, Woods (subtropical). Mastodons: Open, Woods (prehistoric).

**Monster Type:** Demihuman (Rare).

Elves can also appear as NPCs. Otherwise, they might be encountered as travelers or wilderness patrols. In hand-to-hand combat, they attack as first level fighters. Each elf will have one 1st level spell (chosen at random). If 15 or more elves appear, one of them will be a leader (level 2-7). To check for possible items the leader may have, multiply the leader's level by 5. The result is the percent chance for that leader to own a magical item from any one particular subtable. Roll separately for each subtable, checking them all. As long as their leader is alive and fighting with them, elven morale is 10 rather than 8. Elves cannot be paralyzed by ghouls.

**Monster Type:** Humanoid (Rare).

The faerie inhabit the air and clouds. Faeries are close relatives of the demihumans, with features of each race: They appear as halfing-sized humanoids with gossamer wings, dwarfish noses and beards, and elvish ears and eyes. Faeries' bodies are light and they fly with little effort.

They build their homes of "clouds," and enjoy basking in the sun while storms rage below. They have their own great empire of the wind far above the earth, commonly known only to themselves and a few air creatures.

Faeries are naturally invisible at all times, and never appear to normal sight. Faeries can see invisible things easily. The following abilities are common to all faeries, usable at will, up to once per round: *assume gaseous form* (like the potion, create fog/a 10' cube around the faerie), *condense fog* (causing drizzle within fog), return to normal form (from gaseous), *summon breeze* (causes open flames to flicker, blows out candles, and enables the faerie to move at a 360' (120') rate).

Common faeries have 1 + 1 Hit Dice, but leaders have up to 9 Hit Dice. Spellcasters are rare but do exist (magic-users and clerics); see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

**Monster Type:** Giant Animal (Common).

Giant ferrets, like normal ferrets, are long, slender mammals with yellow-white fur and red eyes. But giant ferrets grow to 3' in length, more than twice as long as normal ferrets. Giant ferrets hunt giant rats, and are slender, fast and strong enough to seek these creatures out in their underground lairs. They are sometimes trained for this purpose. Unfortunately, their tempers are highly unpredictable, and they have been known to attack their trainers and other humans.

**Terrain:** Cavern, Woods.

**Monster Type:** Giant Animal (Common).

These monsters are just three typical examples of the category of "giant fish," many others exist, and the DM may create as many as he wishes.

Giant Bass: These are normally shy fish, and will attack only if a morsel of food (halfing-sized or smaller) is floating nearby or on the surface. They may also be summoned, and directed to fight, by nixies.

Giant Spiny Rockfish: This fish, found in shallow salt water, is very difficult to see. Observers may mistake it for a large rock or lump of coal (70% chance). If disturbed, the fish will attack to drive off foes. If it hits a victim or is touched by accident, the victim is automatically hit by

four of the sharp spines covering the creature's body; the victim takes Id4 points of damage per spine and requiring a saving throw vs. poison for each hit. Any failure results in death. Despite its fearsome attacks, the fish is normally peaceful, and will only attack if disturbed.

Giant Sturgeon: This dangerous creature is almost 30' long and covered with thick armorlike scales. It is a fierce fighter, and can swallow an opponent with an attack roll of 18 or better. The victim takes 2d6 points of damage per round and must make a saving throw vs. death ray or be paralyzed. If not paralyzed, the victim may attack from within.

**Terrain:** River/Lake, Ocean.

**Monster Type:** Gargantua Carrion Crawler:

Lowlife (Very Rare); Gargantua Gargoyle: Construct, Enchanted (Very Rare); Gargantua Troll: Giant Humanoid (Very Rare).

A *gargantua* is a very large variety of some other monster. A gargantua is the same type of monster as its smaller form, thus a gargantuan gargoyle is a construct, a gargantuan troll is a giant humanoid, and so on.

These monsters are extremely rare, the products of the mad wizard Gargantua. Three examples of Gargantuan creatures are given above.

Because of their incredible size, gargantuas are noisy while moving, and cannot surprise anything. They also suffer a -4 penalty to their attack rolls when attacking man-size or smaller opponents.

# Chapter 14: Monsters

The statistics for any gargantuan monster are calculated as follows:

- Height: 2 times normal
- Hit Dice: 8 times normal, counting each "plus" as one Hit Die added
- Movement rate: 2 times normal
- Damage: 4 times normal
- Number Appearing: 1
- Save As: Fighter of level equal to its Hit Dice; half level if unintelligent
- Morale: 11
- Treasure Type: 4 times normal size, at 2 times normal percentages

Armor class, alignment, number and type of attacks, and normal and magical abilities are unchanged, *except* for regeneration (4 times normal rate).

*Terrain:* Same as the original species.

*Load:* Eight times normal.

*Monster Type:* Construct, Enchanted (Rare).

Gargoyles are magical constructs, created by wizards for various tasks—especially as guards for treasure chambers and other sites. Many thousands have been created over the centuries; most of them eventually escape or outlive their masters and leave to form their own groups.

As pictured in medieval architecture, they are humanoid creatures with horns, claws, fangs, and batlike wings; they are considered hideous-looking beasts. Their skin often looks exactly like stone and they are often mistaken for statues.

Gargoyles are very cunning, at least semi-intelligent, and incredibly patient. Never needing food or drink, they can sit and watch a site literally for years.

Because of the purposes for which they were created, gargoyles tend to be very territorial creatures. If not still commanded by a wizard, they will normally choose a place (such as a ruined building, a cave complex, or a mountain) and defend it from all intruders, attacking nearly anything that encroaches on their territory.

Gargoyles can only be hit with magic or magical weapons and are not affected by *sleep* or *charm* spells. The DM should not use gargoyles unless the player characters have at least one magical weapon.

*Monster Type:* Monster (Common).

This monster looks like a great quantity of clear jelly, usually in the form of a  $10' imes 10' imes 10'$  cube. It is hard to see, and it surprises often (1-4 on Id6). A gelatinous cube moves through the rooms and corridors of a dungeon, sweeping the halls clean of all living and dead material. In the process, it may pick up items it cannot dissolve (such as weapons, coins, and gems). The gelatinous cube will attack any living creature it encounters. Any successful hit will do damage to the victim and will also paralyze him unless a saving throw vs. paralysis is made. This paralysis lasts 2d4 turns unless magically cured. An attack on a paralyzed target automatically hits (only a damage roll is needed). The gelatinous cube will continue attacking creatures until it dies or they do; if it wins, it sweeps up the dead with all the other trash and continues on its path.

A gelatinous cube may be harmed by fire and weapons, but not by cold or lightning. The lair of these strange monsters may contain Id4 cubes (each with treasure type V, but usually no additional treasure). The lair will not have any "young" gelatinous cubes; adults split into two fully grown cubes.

*Terrain:* Cavern. Ruins.

*Monster Type:* Undead (Common).

Ghouls are undead creatures, immune to *sleep* and *charm* spells. They are hideous, beastlike creatures who will attack and eat any living thing. They have no real memories of their former lives; they do not talk, and have little more than animal intelligence. Any hit from a ghoul will paralyze any creature of ogre-size or smaller (except elves) unless the victim makes a saving throw vs. paralysis. Once an opponent is paralyzed, the ghoul will turn and attack another opponent, continuing until either the ghoul or all the opponents are paralyzed or dead. This paralysis lasts 2d4 turns unless magically cured.

These creatures do not like the sun. They tend to live in graveyards, clustering in empty tombs when not hunting. Ghouls are also scavengers, feeding on carrion when living prey is scarce.

*Terrain:* Cavern. Ruins.

Monster Type: Giant Humanoid (Hill Giants—Common, Others—Rare)Giants are huge humanlike monsters. The "lesser" forms of giants (fire, frost, hill and stone) are crudely-formed and ugly, while the "greater" races (cloud, mountain, sea and storm) are much more like humans in form and nature.

Giants either live solitary lives or live in communities of their own kind; in either case, they tend to live far away from human and demi-human civilizations. There can be giant spellcasters (hill, stone, frost, fire, cloud, and storm giants only); see "Monster Spellcasters" in this chapter.

Lesser giants are usually willing to negotiate when encountered, as they have heard of the dangers of attacking men. Greater giants usually have no prejudice against adventurers and sometimes will entertain them as guests. However, giants stake out large tracts of land as their own and sometimes destroy human communities built in the lands they've claimed. Also, some few rogue giants develop habits which bring them into conflict with adventurers—such as a bandit's habit of robbery, a ghoul's taste for human flesh, or an evil wizard's desire to rule lesser beings.

All giants can throw boulders as missile weapons, though the range varies. Any hit from a thrown boulder inflicts 3d6 points of damage. Throwing ranges in yards (for outdoor encounters) are given for each giant. If encountered in a dungeon, the range should be read as feet.

Hill Giants: These hairy brutes are 12' tall and very stupid. They wear animal skins and carry huge clubs and spears. They sometimes (25%)

They live in hills or at the base of mountains, and raid human communities from time to time for food and plunder.

Stone Giants: These giants are 14' tall and have gray rocklike skin. They use large stalactites as clubs. They often hurl rocks (ranges 100/200/300). They live in caves or crude stone huts, and may have 1d4 cave bears as guards (50% chance).

Frost Giants: These awesome giants have pale skin and light yellow or light blue hair. They stand 18' tall, have long full beards, and wear fur skins and iron armor. Frost giants may hurl rocks (ranges 60/130/200). They often build castles above the timberline of snow-capped mountains. Frost giants always have either 3d6 polar bears (20% chance) or 6d6 wolves (80%) as guards. They are not affected by cold-based attacks.

Fire Giants: These giants have red skin and dark black hair and beards. They are 16' tall and wear copper, brass, or bronze armor. They often throw rocks (ranges 60/130/200). Fire giants usually make their home near volcanoes or other equally hot places. Their castles are often made of black baked mud reinforced with crude iron. They always have either 1d3 hydras (20% chance) or 3d6 hellhounds (80%) as guards. These giants are not affected by fire-based attacks.

Cloud Giants: These fierce giants have white or gray skin and hair. They wear pale robes and stand 20' tall. Cloud giants have keen eyes and a sharp sense of smell, so they are rarely surprised (1 chance in 6). They may throw boulders (ranges 60/130/200). They live in castles in the sides of mountains or atop masses of clouds. They keep either 1d6 small rocks (in clouds or mountains) or 6d6 dire wolves (only in mountains) as guards. Cloud giants hate to be disturbed and may block mountain passes to discourage trespassers.

Storm Giants: These are the tallest giants, often over 22' tall. They have bronze-colored skin and bright red or yellow hair. They rarely (10%)

throw boulders (ranges 150/300/450). They love thunderstorms, and may create one in 1 turn. If a storm is present, a storm giant may throw one lightning bolt every 5 rounds. This bolt will do damage equal to the remaining hit points of the giant (a saving throw vs. spells will reduce this to half damage). Storm giants live on mountain tops, in cloud castles, or deep under water. Their castles will always be guarded by either 2d4 griffons (in mountains and clouds) or 3d6 giant crabs (under water). Lightning does not affect these giants, and they are often found in the middle of fierce storms, enjoying the weather.

Mountain Giants: These appear similar to stone or hill giants. They are hairy, have grayish skin, and stand 12' to 20' tall (usually 1' per Hit Die). They often (80%) carry boulders, and can throw them great distances (100/200/400), for 4d6 points of damage each. They are usually reclusive but mercenary, and may be hired to fight for any large force. In melee combat, they use huge swords or stone dubs (for 1d10 x 5 damage).

Sea Giants: These normally friendly creatures are rarely seen, preferring to live in the deepest canyons of the ocean depths. They appear identical to humans, except for their height (15' to 20' tall). Sea giants breathe water, but can hold their breaths for up to a full turn when venturing out of the sea (which is something they do very rarely). Though able to use weapons (usually huge spears, doing 1d10 x 4 damage), they rarely do so. They can push water with great force, creating a current (underwater) in a cone-shaped area 50' long and 30' wide at its base; all within that area are shoved 60' away from the giant at great speed (no saving throw), and each victim must make a saving throw vs. death ray or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. On the surface, this current becomes a wave with the same effect but of greater size (120' long and 60' wide at the base), and inflicts 2d6 hull points of damage to any vessel in its path.

Terrain: Variable by giant type.

*Monster Type:* Humanoid (Common).

Gnolls are ferocious humanoids of low intelligence. They resemble a cross between a human and a hyena. They live in rough, rugged wasteland and wilderness areas. Gnolls may use all weapons, but most do not work metal; they steal most of their metal weapons from humans. They are strong, but dislike work and prefer to bully and steal. For every 20 gnolls encountered, one will be a leader with 16 hit points who attacks as a 3 Hit Die monster.

Gnolls are rumored to be the result of a magical combination of a gnome and a troll by an evil magic-user.

There can be gnoll spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

*Monster Type:* Humanoid (Common).

Gnomes are a humanoid race related to (but smaller than) dwarves. They stand 3 1/2 to 4' tall and have long noses and full beards. Gnomes have well-developed infrawision, with a 90' range. They usually live in burrows in the lowlands or in underground communities.

Gnomes are excellent smiths and miners. They love gold and gems and have been known to take foolish risks just to obtain them. They love machinery of all kinds and prefer crossbows and war hammers as weapons. Gnomes like most dwarves, but make war with goblins and kobolds, who steal their precious gold. They usually attack kobolds on sight.

For every 20 gnomes, one will be a leader with 11 hit points who fights as a 2 Hit Die monster. In the gnome city or village lives a clan chieftain and his 1d6 bodyguards. The clan chieftain has 18 hit points, attacks as a 4 Hit Die monster, and gains a bonus of +1 on damage rolls. The bodyguards have 10-13 hit points and attack as 3 HD monsters. As long as the clan chieftain or leader is alive, all gnomes within sight of him have a morale of 10 rather than 8.

*Monster Type:* Humanoid (Common).

Goblins are a humanoid race, small (3 1/2' to 4 1/2' tall) and very ugly by human standards. They have pointed ears and misshapen teeth. Their skin is a pale earthy color, such as chalky tan or livid gray. Their eyes are red, and glow when there is little light.

Goblins live underground in caves and caverns

and have well-developed infravision, with a 90' range. In full daylight they fight with a penalty of -1 on their attack rolls. They normally send hunting parties out at night to scavenge food and attack poorly-defended groups of humans. There is a 20% chance that when goblins are encountered outdoors, 1 of every 4 will be riding a dire wolf. Goblins hate dwarves and will attack them on sight.

In the goblin lair lives a goblin king with 15 hit points who fights as a 3 HD monster and gains a +1 bonus to damage rolls. The goblin king has a bodyguard of 2d6 goblins who fight as 2 Hit Dice monsters and have 2d6 hit points each. The king and his bodyguard may fight in full daylight without a penalty. The goblin morale is 9 rather than 7 as long as their king is with them and still alive.

*Monster Type:* Construct, Enchanted (Rare).

A golem is a "construct," a powerful, enchanted monster created and animated by a high level magic-user or cleric. Golems can be made of almost any material. The DM should feel free to create new types as desired.

Golems can only be damaged by magic or magical weapons. They are also immune to *sleep*, *charm*, and *hold* spells, as well as all gases (since they do not breathe). The creation of a golem is discussed in Chapter 16.

**Wood Golem:** Crude manlike figures about 3' tall, they move stiffly, with a penalty of -1 on initiative rolls. They burn easily, with a -2 penalty to all saving throws vs. fire, and all such attacks gain +1 point per die of damage. They are immune to all cold-based attacks and all missile fire, including *magic missile* spells.

**Bone Golem:** These are 6'-tall creatures made from human bones bound together into a man-like form. Their four arms may be attached nearly anywhere on their bodies. Four one-handed weapons (or two two-handed ones) may be used by a bone golem, and it may attack two enemies each round. Bone golems are immune to fire, cold, and electrical attacks.

**Obsidian Golem:** Golems made of obsidian will appear as sharp-featured humanoids carved of this black glass. Obsidian golems have only low intelligence, but they have the power of speech, and can be controlled by simple com-

mands, passwords, or riddles. In combat, an obsidian golem reduced to 0 hit points will shatter into worthless rubble.

**Mud Golem:** A mud golem stands about 6' tall and is shaped much like a muscular human fighter. It can swim or walk on the surface of mud and quicksand without sinking. It can remain submerged in the substances indefinitely without sinking, rising to the surface when it wishes. Mud golems hug their victims with both arms, trying to smother the victim in its body. If a mud golem hits, it will automatically cause 2d6 points of smothering damage each round thereafter.

**Amber Golem:** These resemble giant cats, usually lions or tigers. They are faultless trackers and can detect invisible creatures within 60'.

**Bronze Golem:** These creations look somewhat like fire giants and stand 16' tall. Their skin is bronze and their blood is liquid fire. Any creature hit by a bronze golem takes 1d10 extra points of damage from the great heat inside it (unless the victim is resistant to fire). Anyone scoring damage on a bronze golem with an edged weapon must make a saving throw vs. death ray or take 2d6 points of damage from the fiery "blood" spurning out of the wound. Bronze golems are not affected by fire-based attacks.

*Terrain:* Variable.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Very Rare); Planar Monster (Very Rare).

A gorgon is a magical bull-like monster covered with large ironlike scales. It is usually found in hills or grasslands. It may either attack with its great horns (often charging for double damage), or use its horrible breath weapon. Its breath is a cloud of vapor, 60' long and 10' wide. Those within it must make a saving throw vs. turn to stone, or be petrified. Gorgons are immune to their breath weapons and all other petrifying attacks. Gorgons are native to both the Prime Plane and their original home, the elemental plane of Earth.

**Plane of Earth:** On the plane of Earth, a gorgon is a local herd animal, bred by the *horde* creatures (see below) and "milked" (though this fluid is bitter and oily, in human terms) or slain for food. Its breath can still petrify creatures not made of earth (saving throw applies).

*Elemental Plane of Earth Statistics:* HD 4, IAT 1 horn, D 1-4, NA 1-8 (3-36), Save F4, ML 5, TT Nil, AL N, XP 75.

**Monster Type:** Lowlife (Common).

Grab grass looks like ordinary tall grass (3'-5' tall). Grab grass is animated and will attempt to hold any individual that moves into or through it. There is a 5% chance each round that anyone with a strength of 12 or less can break free of the grab grass. For every point of strength greater than 12, the chance increases by 5% (an individual with 16 strength, for example, would have a 25% chance each round to break free).

The grab grass patch has one Hit Die for every 5' square area (thus 5' square are destroyed for every 8 hit points of damage done to the grass).

**Terrain:** Hill, Jungle, Open.

| XP Value:      | 50        |

**Monster Type:** Lowlife (Common).

This seeping horror looks like wet stone—usually a patch about 8' in diameter, or a boulder about 4' in diameter—and is difficult to see. It secretes an acid which does 2d8 points of damage if it touches bare skin. This acid will dissolve and destroy normal armor or weapons in only 1 round, and magical items in one turn. After the first hit, the ooze sticks to its victim, automatically destroying any normal armor and continuing to inflict 2d8 points of damage each round.

Gray ooze cannot be harmed by cold or fire, but can be harmed by weapons and lightning. A lair may contain 1d4 oozes, possibly with a special treasure made of stone (DM's choice).

**Terrain:** Cavern, Ruins.

**Monster Type:** Lowlife (Common).

Green slime cannot be harmed by any attacks except fire or cold. It dissolves cloth or leather instantly, wood and metal in 6 rounds, but cannot dissolve stone. Green slime often clings to walls and ceilings and drops down in a surprise attack.

Once in contact with flesh, it sticks and turns the flesh into green slime. It cannot be scraped off, but may be burnt off, or treated with a *cure disease* spell.

When green slime drops on a victim (or is stepped on), the victim can usually burn it while it is dissolving armor and clothing. If it is not burned off, the victim will turn completely into green slime 1d4 rounds after the first 6-round (one minute) period. Burning does half damage to the green slime and half damage to the victim.

**Terrain:** Cavern, Ruins.

| XP Value:      | 16         |

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

Gremlins are 3'-tall humanoid with pasty gray-green skin, large saucer-shaped eyes and pointed ears. They are whimsical and have an evil sense of humor. Gremlins can radiate a *chaotic aura* with a 20' radius. Inside the area of effect, "anything that can go wrong will go wrong" at the DM's discretion. Characters must successfully save vs. spells each round to avoid the effect of the gremlins.

Gremlins have no attack other than their chaotic aura. However, any creature that attacks a gremlin and misses must roll a second attack against him or herself. Any character casting a spell within the *chaotic aura* must roll a save vs. spells. If successful, the spell affects the gremlins; if unsuccessful, the spell affects the caster.

Gremlin magic usually affects mechanical devices before nonmechanical devices. A crossbow might break in half, axeheads might fall off their shaft, etc. The exact effects of gremlin magic depends on the DM's imagination. In general, the magic is not deadly but is playfully malignant. Gremlins live in deep, hidden caves.

There can be gremlin spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

A griffin has the head, wings, and front claws of an eagle and the body and hindquarters of a lion. Its favorite prey is horses. When within 120' of a horse, a griffin must make a morale check or attack immediately. It can carry off a horse-sized creature at half its flying rate.

Wild griffons may be tamed if captured young, becoming loyal mounts. Tamed griffons are still likely to attack horses, however, and must check morale as above.

**Monster Type:** Black Hag: Humanoid (Very Rare). Sea Hag: Humanoid, Enchanted (Very Rare).

Hags appear as ugly human females, but are actually monsters. They have the common ability to control undead as if they were also undead (though they are not undead). Each hag is treated as double its Hit Dice for control calculations (sea hag as if 16 HD, black hag as if 22-40 HD; see the Undead Lieges and Pawns section later this chapter for details about controlling undead.) Each type of hag is also immune to all special abilities of undead (including energy drain, paralysis, undead-created disease or poison, etc.).

Black: A black hag has black hair and blue-black warty skin. It can cast spells as if a cleric

(level equal to its Hit Dice), but rarely uses its powers for healing (except itself), preferring results of death and destruction. If a black hag does not cast spells, it renders its opponents with its poisonous iron claws; any victim hit must make a saving throw vs. poison with a -4 penalty, or die.

Black hags live in dark caves or in rude thatched huts deep in gloomy forests. They often keep various slimes, oozes, and puddings for company, and are always accompanied by 3d6 evil monsters, many of them undead (but rarely all).

Sea: This is one of the ugliest creatures known, and has the foulest habits imaginable. All who see it or even approach within 10' must immediately make a saving throw vs. spells with a -6 penalty, or flee in fear and disgust for 1d20 + 5 rounds. A sea hag can be harmed only by silver or magical weapons. It lives mostly in shallow ocean waters near coasts, but may venture on land for up to three hours at a time. Its touch is both an energy drain of one level (as a wight's), and a cause *disease* (neither effect allowing a saving throw).

**Terrain:** Black Hag: Woods. Sea Hag: Ocean (coast).

### Monster Type: Demihuman (Common).

Halflings can also appear as NPCs. Otherwise, they are usually encountered close to their settlements. They attack as first level fighters, receiving a +1 attack bonus when using missile weapons. Halflings get a 2 armor class bonus when fighting larger than man-sized enemies. They are good at hiding, and in woods or underbrush can vanish so well that there is only a 10% chance that anyone searching for them will succeed. For every 10 halflings, there will be one leader (level 2). As long as their leader is alive and fighting with them, their morale is 10 rather than 8. They live in small villages of 30-300 inhabitants. Each village, or shire, has a sheriff (level 2-7) and a village guard of 5-20 militia with 2 Hit Dice. Treasure type B is found only if the halflings are encountered in a wilderness setting.

**Terrain:** Hill, Open.

### Monster Type: Monster (Rare).

A harpy has the lower body of a giant eagle and the upper body and head of a hideous-looking woman. Harpies can sing with enchanting, mesmerizing voices. By singing, harpies lure creatures to them, to be killed and devoured. Any creature hearing the harpies' songs must make a saving throw vs. spells or be *charmed*. If a victim makes a saving throw against the songs of a group of harpies, the victim will not be affected by any of their songs during the encounter.

Harpies typically make their nests in out-of-the-way places where there is a certain amount of human traffic: beside mountain passes along caravan routes, on small hills along trade routes, etc. The harpies try to lure all travelers to their death. Should they succeed to the point that no new travelers ever come by, they will simply move to a new site and start all over again.

There can be harpy spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

### DM Checklist:

Attacks: Ectoplasmic Net; Gaze (Paralysis); Aging damage per blow.

Defenses: Immune to all spells except those affecting evil; harmed only by +2 or better weapons; saving throw vs. turning/destruction (spells).

**Monster Type:** Undead, Enchanted (Very Rare).

A haunt is an undead soul of some creature (usually human) unable to rest. Haunts are most often encountered near the spots where their mortal bodies died—often a bog, old forest, or dungeon. They avoid, but are not harmed by, sunlight and magical light.

Haunts can only be harmed by magical weapons of +2 or greater enchantment. They are immune to all spells except those which affect evil. Each haunt has its own special attack form, given in the descriptions.

Haunts do not inflict normal damage; they cause aging with their physical blows. Each

![Illustration of a woman in traditional Chinese attire confronting a man in a cowboy hat and jacket, who is holding a sword. The man appears to be a ghost or a monster.]()![](_page_182_Picture_1.jpeg)

haunt can create an *ectoplasmic net* while doing other things, and all haunts can use a gaze attack as well as its special or physical attacks. If seriously threatened (or if morale fails), a haunt will escape into the Ethereal Plane and not return for 1d8 days. A haunt can only enter the Ether three times per day, but can leave it at any time.

**Net:** When first encountered, a haunt will normally start oozing ectoplasm. This appears as wispy tendrils, slowly forming a net. The net has no effect on the movement of the haunt or others, however, and is only a visual effect for three rounds; but after that time, the net is complete, forming a 10' radius around the haunt and moving with it. Any living creature within a complete ectoplasmic net must make a saving throw vs. spells or be pulled into the Ethereal Plane (where the net also exists). The ethereal victim is helpless unless he possesses special items or spells that permit travel from that plane (*oil of etheralness*, *teleport*, etc.). The haunt will attack its ethereal victims when it returns to the Ether.

**Gaze:** A haunt's gaze attack has a 60' range, and may be used once per round (against a single victim) at most, in addition to other attack forms. The victim of the gaze must make a saving throw vs. spells or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. A haunt often ignores its paralyzed victims, concentrating its attacks on other enemies nearby, until only helpless ones remain.

**Aging:** Each blow from a haunt ages the victim by 1d4 x 10 years. Elves may ignore the effects of the first 200 years of aging; dwarves may ignore the first 50 years, and halfings, the first 20 years. Otherwise, each 10 years of aging will cause the victim to lose 1 point of Constitution.

This loss is permanent and cumulative (each additional 10 years drains another point). A *wish* will restore only one point lost in this manner, and less powerful magic cannot affect the loss. All aging can be countered only with a *potion of longevity* or a *wish*. If a victim's Constitution drops to 0, the victim dies permanently, and cannot be *raised*.

**Turning:** When a cleric's attempt at turning a haunt gives a "D" result, the creature may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid destruction. If the saving throw is successful, the monster is not turned or destroyed, although the cleric can repeat the attempt. Other turning results are handled normally.

Each haunt keeps the treasure of its victims in some area near the place where it is encountered. Victims of haunts do not become haunts themselves unless they are extremely evil beings.

**Banshee:** This lonely haunt prefers desolate moors and outdoor places, though it is occasionally found underground. It is a guardian of sorts, and may actually help one race in its area (often sprites or pixies) by frightening and chasing enemies away. It is rumored that a banshee is the soul of an evil female elf, atoning for its misdeeds in life.

A banshee can use its special attack, a *wail*, three times per day. All victims within 60' must make a saving throw vs. death ray or die on the spot. The creature often uses one wall at an out-of-range distance to ward off approaching enemies; an immediate morale check must be made for NPCs and monsters hearing it, with a +4 penalty to the roll. The banshee may be tricked

into wailing again (if the opponents are very clever), but will not use its third wail until it is in the midst of combat. If avoided, a banshee will not pursue.

Ghost: Of all the more powerful undead, only a ghost may be of any alignment.

Every ghost has the ability to use a *magic jar* effect (similar to the spell; range 30') on one victim per turn. If successful, one item carried by the ghost will glow, powered by the life force of its victim. The ghost's force then possesses the body of the victim, and causes it to attack others. During this time, and for as long as it possesses another, the ghost's figure stops, merely holding the light (but oozing the *ectoplasmic net*). The ghost and the item both remain ethereal. If its *magic jar* attempt fails, a ghost usually materializes and attacks with blows or its gaze attack.

Some ghosts appear in forms related to their death. A drowned human might appear soaked in water, soaking all things around it; the ghost of a person who died of fire might appear cloaked in ethereal flames. The DM may add details of this sort whenever desired.

A *Lawful* ghost appears as a transparent human, usually carrying a lantern or candle. If attacked, it can respond with the same attacks as any other ghost. If approached with caution, the ghost will gesture. If followed, it will lead to a special clue or treasure, and then disappear. Some *Lawful* ghosts exist only to guide *Lawful* living beings away from some area of great danger.

A *Neutral* ghost is a human soul who has become trapped, unable to rest, either because the body remains unburied, or because the being was greatly betrayed, harmed, or cursed. If this type of ghost is aided, and the body found and returned to a churchyard, the ghost will rest in peace. When aided, the ghost usually reveals its treasure hoard.

A *Chaotic* ghost looks like a nearly transparent bundle of cloth. It may assume any form desired, even (but rarely) that of a *Lawful* or *Neutral* ghost. Whatever the form, the creature will always have a dark candle, torch, or lantern with it. When first encountered, a *Chaotic* ghost uses its *magic jar* spell immediately unless it is masquerading as one of the other types.

**Poltergeist:** This strange being is completely invisible, having the form of a cluster of ectoplasmic tentacles with dozens of tiny eyes. It cannot be seen except by magic. Its gaze attack will only affect creatures able to see invisible things.

A poltergeist throws and moves things with its tentacles. It is usually found in an area where loose items (sticks, rocks, etc.) can be easily picked up and used; otherwise, the poltergeist will move items carried by the intruders. The monster can throw two items per round; the damage done varies by the size of the item, from as little as 1 point (for a small stick) to 3d6 points (a large rock). In addition, any victim hit must make a saving throw vs. spells or age 10 years; this saving throw must be made for every hit.

Unlike other haunts, poltergeists inhabit only indoor or underground areas, and may be found in groups.

**Terrain:** Ruins.

### Monster Type: Human (Rare)

Headsmen (also called "executioners") are NPC humans commonly employed by dominion rulers. They are trained in the business of killing criminals who have received the death penalty. Most headsmen are skilled in the proper use of bladed weapons, ropes, and poisons and are able to execute criminals quickly and neatly.

All professional headsmen belong to their own guild, which is associated with the Thieves' Guild. Headsmen keep their true identities completely secret, wearing hoods or disguises when engaged in professional activities. Many own ordinary shops, and can seem to be perfectly ordinary townfolk. Headsmen of 6 HD or more are 90% undetectable in their disguises, and study languages of all sorts to improve their masquerades. Headsmen of 10 HD or more can even use the secret languages of other alignments.

**Thugs:** A secret organization exists within the Guild of Headsmen. These evil headsmen enjoy their work too much, and offer their services for open hire. Others call them Assassins or Thugs; they call themselves Pragmati ("the practical people").

Unlike the Thieves' Guild, the Pragmati are not supported by adventurers or rulers. They are sometimes hired by other NPCs, especially evil ones. However, PCs do not normally contact these headsmen for any reason; their organization is dangerous as either an enemy or an ally. Thugs are treacherous and self-serving, known to extort money from their previous "clients" with threats of exposure, kidnapping, or even murder.

Thugs strongly prefer stealth, treachery, and ambush to normal attacks. They often use magical devices when attacking powerful opponents; potions, rings, and miscellaneous items are preferred. Thugs rarely use magical weapons, preferring cheap but effective tools that could easily be left behind. They never use spells, though they may hire (or be led by) evil spellcasters.

Thugs usually retreat if wounded, and may flee even if merely discovered, depending on the situation. They rarely attack adventurers, knowing well that magic and other special attacks can be deadly. However, a group of thugs may try to

ambush a party if the chance for success is good, especially if the party has recently been wounded. Sometimes thugs may be hired as guards, if assured of high level clerical assistance when injured or slain. They may rarely be found working with bandits or other renegade groups, often unbeknownst to the bandits themselves.

**Thug Special Abilities:** Thugs know methods to kill quickly, neatly, and silently. A thug also has the same special abilities as a thief of the same level; for example, a 6 Hit Die thug can climb walls with a 92% chance of success. Thugs use standard monster attack roll tables, not those for characters.

A thug may make preparations to surprise a victim; if so, a roll of 1-3 (instead of 1-2) indicates surprise. These preparations often include disguise, success at moving silently (as the thief ability), and a strong cord or edged weapon held ready, possibly while successfully hiding in shadows.

If a prepared thug gains surprise, the victim may be slain with a single blow, regardless of hit points. No attack roll is made; instead, the base chance of success is 50%, modified by the difference in Hit Dice, as follows: if the victim's level is greater than the Thug's, subtract 5% per Hit Die; if the victim's level is less than the Thug's, add 5% per Hit Die. If the thug does not gain surprise, a normal attack roll is made, and normal damage is inflicted if the attempt succeeds. A successful hit may also require the victim to make a saving throw vs. poison if the thug is using a poisoned blade.

**Example:** A 7 HD thug attempting to kill a 3 HD fighter has a chance of 50% plus 20% (for 4 HD difference in the thug's favor), or 70%. If the same thug tried to kill a 25th level fighter lord, the chance is 50% minus 10% (2 HD difference in the victim's favor), or 40%. Remember that the fighter has only 9 HD (despite his or her added hit points per level above that), for a difference of only 2 Hit Dice in this example.

### Monster Type: Planar Monster, Enchanted (Very Rare).

Helions are intelligent giant-sized creatures made of fire. They are native to the elemental plane of Fire, and are rarely encountered elsewhere. Helions are extremely good, and shun violence.

A helion appears as a 20' diameter ring of flame. It is immune to poison, normal weapons, all 1st and 2nd level spells, and to all attacks based on earth.

A helion can *detect invisible* at will, and can use *detect magic, dispel magic, wall offire*, and *earth to fire* three times per day. It can also con-

trol fire completely, changing it to solid, liquid, or gaseous form at will (saving throw applies for fire-type creatures).

A helion attacks by forming a ring around its opponent. If its attack roll is successful, it shrinks around the victim, who then cannot move. The helion may squeeze for 2d8 points of damage (per round), but rarely tries to damage opponents in this way, preferring to negotiate peaceful terms. It will, however, defend itself if attacked.

Helions are famous philosophers and negotiators. Their enemies are the effect and the haouou, and they fear water-type creatures and attacks.

This reddish-brown doglike monster is as big as a small pony. They are often found near volcanoes, deep in dungeons, or with other fire-loving creatures (such as fire giants).

Helhounds are cunning and highly intelligent. They can often *detect invisible* (as the magic-user spell), 75% chance per round, range 60'. They are immune to normal fire, and make all saving throws as fighters of equal Hit Dice.

A hellhound will attack one victim, either breathing fire (one chance in three: 1-2 on 1d6) or biting (two chances in three: 3-6 on 1d6) each round. The breath does 1d6 points of damage for each Hit Die of the hound. The victim of the breath may make a saving throw vs. dragon breath to take half damage.

### Monster Type: Monster (Rare).

A hippogriff is a fantastic creature with the foreparts and head of a giant eagle and the hindquarters of a horse. They are a magical cross-breed descended from both griffons and horses. They are carnivorous, preferring plains herd

beasts, and can carry off man-sized or smaller prey. They can be ridden if tamed; this is easiest when they are raised from young. Hippogriffs nest in rocky crags, but may fly anywhere in search of prey.

Hippogriffs will usually attack pegasi, who are their natural enemies. Even when ridden, they must make a morale check each turn they see pegasi, or will turn and attack those creatures despite their riders' orders.

Monster Type: Humanoid (Common).

Hobgoblins are relatives of goblins, but are bigger and meaner. They live underground in caves and dungeons, but often hunt outdoors in rough, rugged wasteland and wilderness (having no penalties in daylight).

A hobgoblin king and 1d4 bodyguards live in the hobgoblin lair. The king has 22 hit points and fights as a 5 Hit Dice monster, gaining a bonus of +2 on damage rolls. The bodyguards all fight as 4 Hit Dice monsters and have 3d6 hit points each. As long as their king is alive and with them, hobgoblin morale is 10 rather than 8. A hobgoblin king might have one or more throuls in his bodyguard as well (see *Thoul*).

There can be hobgoblin spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

Monster Type: Planar Monster (Very Rare).

"The hordes" are life forms native to the elemental plane of Earth. Each single life force has hundreds of separate insectlike bodies. The size of the bodies ranges from 3 to 21 feet long; the length corresponds to the Hit Dice (i.e., a 3-HD body will be 3' long). Details on the individual bodies are given above.

One horde life force can control up to 10,000 Hit Dice of bodies. Replacement bodies can be created at the rate of 1 Hit Die per turn. Unlike insects, there is no "queen" body; the life force is widely spread, occupying all the bodies evenly. The life force can only control bodies within a volume 100 miles across; if taken outside that range, a body becomes a mindless thing, dying

in 1-10 days. Each planet in the realm of the hordes is occupied by 1d100 life forces.

Each individual life force has its own name. All the bodies of a single life force will respond to the same name, and this can cause confusion in dealing with a horde creature. The creature itself can only die if *all* of its bodies are destroyed.

The horde creatures do not consider any other life forms to be intelligent. When a horde needs more room, it will simply try to take it, without regard for other creatures; thus, they are considered evil. The horde creatures often grapple with each other in this war for living space.

A horde creature can use *ESP* and *telekinesis* (up to 2,000 cn) as often as desired, up to once per round. It communicates by *telepathy*, speaking directly to the minds of others. It is incredibly intelligent, and can easily handle dozens of conversations at once.

Each horde is very Lawful and always dangerous. A horde creature sacrifices as many bodies as needed to reach a goal, and thus the morale of a body is 12. The creature is immune to all mental effects (*charm*, *hold*, *sleep*, etc.), but the bodies are susceptible to blows and damage-causing attacks of most types. Because of its disregard for individual bodies, a horde normally does not bother to attempt to save them; in play, it simply fails all saving throws voluntarily. However, if 10% or more of a horde's bodies are lost in a single activity (an encounter with enemies, for example), the creature will either resolve the problem peacefully (negotiating, avoiding, etc.) or call other hordes for assistance.

Each horde can have a different species of insect as its bodies. One horde might consist of bodies which look like huge gold praying mantises with wings, while another might consist of smallish black beetles with glowing red tips on their antennae.

The hordes' enemies are the kryst and the undines. They fear fire-type creatures and attacks.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

The hsiao (sh-HOW) are a race of peaceful cleric-philosophers who inhabit woodlands and forests.

Hsiao look like giant owls with broad feathered wings and large intelligent golden eyes. These creatures live in trees, making earthen nests and tunnels high above the forest floor. The hsiao know and work closely with other woodland creatures (including actaeons, centaurs, dryads, elves, treants, and unicorns), and may call on them for aid. Their goals include the preservation of woodland wilderness against intrusions by dangerous humanoids. They will not

interfere with passing PCs who do no damage to the woodlands or the races of the forest.

Most of these avian clerics are 4th level; 25% are higher levels (as given above; maximum level is 15th). Although able to physically defend themselves with their sharp claws and beak, these creatures depend on their spells and the assistance of their woodland allies for protection. The hsiao are known to some druids, though their philosophies (alignments) obviously differ greatly.

No one knows where these creatures come from, but their alignment and clerical powers suggest that they were created to serve the ends of Lawful Immortals.

**Terrain:** Woods.

**Loud:** A hsiao can move at up to full speed when carrying 250 cn x its HD in encumbrance; it can move at half speed when carrying 500 cn x its HD.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

A hydra is a large creature with a dragonlike body and 5-12 snakelike heads. It has one Hit Die for each head, and each head has 8 hit points. Its saving throws are as a fighter level equal to the number of heads.

The hydra will attack with all of its heads every round. For every 8 points of damage a hydra takes, one head is destroyed. For example, if a 7-headed hydra took 18 points of damage, it would only attack with 5 heads in the next round.

Special, unusual hydras can be created. These could have poisonous bites, or breathe fire (as a hellhound, for 8 points of damage per head); a few more examples are shown below. Such creatures should be placed to guard special treasures.

**Sea Hydra:** This monster has adapted to water. It has fins instead of legs. It is otherwise the same as its land-dwelling cousins.

**Flying Hydra:** Very rare and very dangerous, this monster has huge batlike wings, and is never mistaken for a dragon or wyvern. It can swoop down and attack with up to three heads, each head capable of carrying off a man-sized or smaller victim. Its flying movement rate flying is 180' (60') per round; Hit Dice are 5-9\*\*.

**Regenerating Hydra:** This rare and deadly monster regenerates damage very quickly, at 3 hit points per round. However, damage done by fire attacks (including flaming swords) or wounds seared by a brand will not regenerate. Hit Dice are 5-9\*\*.

**Terrain:** Hydra, Regenerating Hydra: Swamp. Sea Hydra: Lake, Ocean. Flying Hydra: Mountain.

A hydrax is an intelligent crablike creature made of ice. It is native to the elemental plane of Water, and is almost never found on the Prime Plane. The hydrax looks like a giant crab with a body 8' long, with six legs and three claws equally positioned around its body. Although the hydrax are Lawful in behavior, most are evil.

Hydrax are immune to normal weapons, all 1st and 2nd level spells, and to all attacks based on fire. A hydrax can *detect invisible* at will, and can cast *detect magic*, *web*, *dispel magic*, *ice storm/wall*, and *water to ice* (much like the reverse of the magic-user's *dissolve* spell, but substituting water and ice for mud and rock) three times per day (all as if a 9th level magic-user).

The hydrax use tools made of ice, and build cities and devices of all sorts. Their enemies are the undines and the kryst, and they fear air-type creatures and attacks.

An insect swarm is not a single creature, but rather a group of small insects acting together. It may be attracted to light or strange smells, or may be defending its lair. Use these characteristics for the occasions when a character stumbles into a beehive or wasp's nest, for instance.

The swarm may fill a  $10' \times 10' \times 30'$  area or more. The insects are normal-sized, either crawlers (ants, centipedes, or spiders), flyers (bees or wasps), or both (beetles or locusts).

"area effect" and automatically hits. All armored victims within the area (and any monsters with AC 5 or better) automatically take 2 points of damage per round. Unarmored victims (and monsters with AC 6 or worse) take 4 points per round.

Any victim who runs out of the swarm, or who *swats* the insects instead of making another attack or taking another action, takes only 1 point per round. To *swat* at the insects, the victim must use a weapon or torch; attempts to *swat* with hands or arms have no effect.

If the swarm is damaged, it will pursue its attacker nearly without fail (ML 11). A victim can still escape either by disappearing from sight (invisible, around a corner, etc.) or diving under water (which kills all the insects after one round, during which normal damage is done).

*Terrain:* Any (except Arctic).

| XP Value:      | 1,200      |

*Monster Type:* Planar Monster, Enchanted (Rare).

An invisible stalker is a magical humanlike monster from another plane of existence, summoned by the magic-user spell *invisible stalker*. If the summoned stalker is given a simple task that is clear and can be swiftly completed, it will obey promptly. If the task is complex or lengthy, the creature will try to distort the intent while obeying the literal command. For example, if ordered to guard a treasure longer than a week, the stalker may take it away to its own plane of existence and guard it there forever.

An invisible stalker is most often used to track and slay enemies. It is highly intelligent, and a faultless tracker. If a victim cannot detect invisible things, the stalker will surprise on a roll of 1-5 (on 1d6). A creature with the ability to detect invisible things receives a +4 bonus when attacking an invisible stalker. The stalker will return to its own plane once it is slain, dispelled, or has completed its task.

The race of "invisible stalkers" (which is the human name for the species) lives on the elemental plane of Air. They call themselves the "sshai." Invisible stalkers are much faster speed on their home plane: 360' (120').

**Plane of Air:** On their home plane, the sshai are much like dopplegangers; they can use ESP at will, and can shapechange to nearly any form native to their plane. They usually appear as air elementals, djinn, or haouou (aerial servants). Their true form is nearly identical to that of an air elemental, though that race can tell the difference. Sshai are occasionally hired by the djinn and the haouou as spies or guards.

Sshai on their own plane may have 1 to 12 Hit Dice, though all are about man-size in their true forms. Some are known to use spells. They prefer

negotiation to combat, and have few enemies. They fear earth-type creatures and attacks.

*Terrain:* Any, Plane of Air.

*Monster Type:* Humanoid (Common).

These small, evil doglike humanoids usually live underground in clans of 10 to 60 members. They have scaly, rust-brown skin no hair. They have well-developed infravision with a 90' range. They prefer to attack by ambush.

A kobold chieftain and 1d6 bodyguards live in the kobold lair. The chieftain has 9 hit points and fights as a 2 Hit Dice monster. The bodyguards each have 6 hit points and fight as 1 + 1 Hit Dice monsters. As long as the chieftain is alive, all kobolds with him have a morale of 8 rather than 6.

Kobolds hate gnomes and will attack them on sight.

There can be kobold spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

*Monster Type:* Planar Monster (Very Rare).

The kryst are intelligent beings made of crystalline rock; each kryst looks like a group of 12 golden crystal spikes, all projecting outward from a central point. They are native to the elemental plane of Earth.

Kryst are immune to poison, normal weapons, all 1st and 2nd level spells, and to all attacks based on air. A kryst can *detect invisible* at will, and can use *detect magic*, *dispel magic*, *haste*, or *air to earth* (similar to the magic-user's *dissolve* spell, but turns air into earth) three times per day (all as if cast by a 9th level magic-user). The kryst communicate by *telepathy* (120' range) or, if mental contact causes poor reactions, by written messages.

A kryst can attack by ramming opponents with its spikes, and can attack up to three times per round.

The kryst have a widespread and complex society in their own realms, peacefully living with and helping the earth elementals. They welcome visi-

tors, and are eager to gain new knowledge of all types. They fear and wage a never-ending war against the *hordes*, and seek to unite all other creatures against them. The kryst are also enemies of the hydrax, though they rarely encounter them. They fear water-type creatures and attacks.

*Monster Type:* Lowlife (Very Rare).

This shapeless monster appears as a puddle or stream of hot molten rock, about  $10' \times 10'$ . It lives in or near a volcano or other place of great heat. Although the ooze is native to the Prime Plane, it can freely exist on the elemental plane of Fire.

Lava ooze is fluid, able to pass through small holes or cracks. It can sense vibrations within 60'. The monster attacks by extending pseudopods (up to three per round) from its fluid body to strike at its opponents up to 15' away. Each hit inflicts 4d6 points of damage, and leaves a coating of lava that inflicts 3d6 points of automatic heat damage per round for 1d4 rounds thereafter. Multiple hits on a single-opponent do not increase this heat damage, but the durations are cumulative.

The lava ooze is mindless and attacks until destroyed. It is immune to fire (both normal and magical) and to all mind attacks (including charm, ESP, etc.), but takes double damage from cold attacks.

*Terrain:* Mountain (volcanic).

A giant leech is a loathsome wormlike creature, thicker in the middle than at the ends; it has reddish-brown skin and is about 3'-4' long. It is a parasite, sucking the blood of its prey. In combat, a giant leech attacks with its suckerlike mouth. If it hits, it then holds on and sucks blood for 1d6 points of damage per round. It must be killed to be removed.

*Terrain:* Swamp.

*Monster Type:* Undead, Enchanted (Very Rare).

A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments, and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, so it is extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering, but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair. Such a lair might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis ("city of the dead").

The very sight of a lich causes *fear* in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its merest touch causes 1d10 points of damage, and can paralyze any creature for 1d100 days (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).

Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature. This should be done with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.

Liches are undead, and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to *charm*, *sleep*, *feeblemind*, *polymorph*, *cold*, *lightning*, and *death* spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level.

Outside of its lair, a lich always carries 1d4 + 1 powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. You should choose these, not randomly determine them. Within its lair, a lich has 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more),

plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (but at 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.

A magic-user lich normally has 1d2 spells on it of permanent nature—most often *detect invisible* or *fly*.

A clerical lich normally has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants. A full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.

Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive 1d100 rounds later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in answer to the summons, roll 1d20 and refer to the table. Roll again if a type of creature has already responded that day.

| Roll  | Creature                   |
|-------|----------------------------|
| 1-5   | Spectre (2d4)              |
| 6-9   | Vampire (1d6)              |
| 10-12 | Phantom, Shade (1d3)       |
| 13-15 | Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic) |
| 16    | Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)   |
| 17    | Spirit, Druj               |
| 18    | Spirit, Revenant           |
| 19    | Nightshade (any 1)         |
| 20    | Undead Beholder            |

A summoned vampire may (25% chance; check for each) be a magic-user or cleric of level 7-9 (1d3+6).

Liches are master villains, coordinating armies and spy-networks made up of the undead. Each one has its own goal: One may want to achieve true Immortality, one may serve an evil Immortal of Entropy, one may wish to transform the entire world into a horrid playground for the undead. Each lich in a campaign should have its own name, style, and motivation.

Draco: A draco is a 6' long lizard with wide flaps of skin between its legs. It spreads these flaps to glide through the air, like a flying squirrel. Dracos are generally found above ground, though they sometimes creep into caves to escape very cold or hot weather. They are carnivores and have been known to attack adventurers.

Homed Chameleon: A horned chameleon is a 7' long lizard which can change color to blend into its surroundings. It surprises on a roll of 1-5 (on 1d6). A horned chameleon can shoot out its sticky tongue up to 5' long. A successful hit means that the victim is pulled to the horned chameleon's mouth and bitten for 2d4 points of damage. Horned chameleons prefer giant in-

Tuatara: A tuatara is an 8' long carnivore which looks like a cross between an iguana and a toad. It has pebble-colored olive skin with white spikes along its back. A tuatara has a membrane over its eyes which, when lowered, is sensitive to changes in temperature, allowing it to "see" in darkness (90' infravision).

Monster Type: Lowlife (Common).Giant locusts are 2'-3' long and live underground. They may be mistaken for statues (or might not be noticed at all) until approached, because of their stone-gray color. They are herbivores, and also eat fungus such as yellow mold and shrickers. They cannot be harmed by yellow mold or most poisons.

Instead of fighting, they usually flee by jumping away (up to 60'). Unfortunately they often become confused, and may accidentally jump into a party (50% chance per jump). If so, a victim is determined randomly and an attack roll is made. If the giant locust hits a character, the victim is battered for 1d4 points of damage. The locust then flies away.

When frightened or attacked, giant locusts make a loud shrieking noise to warn their fellows. In dungeons, this shriek has a 20% chance per round of attracting wandering monsters.

If cornered, a giant locust will spit a brown gooey substance up to 10'. The target is treated as AC 9 regardless of his true armor class. A victim hit by giant locust spittle must make a saving throw vs. poison or be unable to do anything for 1 turn, due to the awful smell. After this time the victim will be used to the smell, but any character approaching within 5' must also make a saving throw or suffer the same effects. This aroma will last until the spittle is washed off.

Lizard men are semi-intelligent and use spears and large clubs (treat the clubs as maces), gaining a bonus of +1 on damage rolls due to their great strength.

One in ten will speak a little Common. PCs can negotiate with lizard men that can talk. If they are hungry enough, though, and the PCs can't deliver them a lot of food, the lizard men will still prefer to eat the characters. Lizard men live hard lives, hunting most of their waking hours. Sometimes they hire themselves out to other races as warriors or scouts. They have no interest in other races other than what those races can do for them (i.e., provide food in one way or another).

Some varieties of lizard men are just drab green or brown in color, while others may be dramatically colorful: Bright reds, blues, yellows, or greens, like some other reptiles.

There can be lizard man spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

t The number in parentheses is the creature's armor class when in human form.

**Monster Type:** Monster, Enchanted (Common).

Lycanthropes are humans who can change into beasts (or in the case of wererats, beasts who can change into humans). They normally wear no armor, since it would interfere with their shape-changing. Any lycanthrope can summon 1d2 normal animals of its type: werebears can summon normal bears, werewolves can summon normal wolves, and so forth. Summoned animals will arrive in 1d4 rounds.

Some animals (such as horses) do not like the smell of lycanthropes and will react with fear. If a lycanthrope is hit by wolvesbane, it must make a saving throw vs. poison or run away in fear. The sprig of wolvesbane must be swung or thrown as a weapon, using normal combat procedures. A lycanthrope returns to its "normal" form when killed.

**Animal Form:** In animal form, a lycanthrope can be harmed only by magical weapons, silvered weapons, or spells. The lycanthrope cannot speak normal languages, though it can speak with normal animals of its weretype.

**Human Form:** In human form, a lycanthrope often looks somewhat like its werewolf. Wererats have longer noses, werebears are hairy, werebats have long arms, werefoxes are sly and nimble, and so forth. In this form, they can be attacked with normal weapons, and they may speak any known languages.

**Lycanthropy:** Lycanthropy is a disease. Any human character who loses more than half of his hit points in battle with a lycanthrope becomes a lycanthrope of the same type in 2d12 days. The disease kills demihumans. The victim begins to show signs of the disease in half that time. The condition can be cured only by a cleric of 11th level or greater, who will do so for a suitable price

![Illustration of a werewolf (lycanthrope) sitting in a tree, looking aggressive and holding a clawed hand out.]()![](_page_189_Picture_13.jpeg)

or service. Any character who becomes a full lycanthrope will become an NPC, to be run by the DM only.

### Common Lycanthropes

**Wererat:** Wererats are different from most lycanthropes because the were-animal form is their natural form, and human form is the shape they assume. They are intelligent, can speak Common in either form, and can use any weapon. A wererat usually prefers to use a man-sized rat form, but can become a full-sized human. Wererats are sneaky and often set ambushes, surprising on a roll of 1-4 (on 1d6). They summon giant rats to help them in battle. Only a wererat's bite causes lycanthropy.

**Werewolf:** These creatures are semi-intelligent and usually hunt in packs. Any group of 5 or more will have a leader with 30 hit points, who attacks as a 5 Hit Dice monster, adding +2 to damage rolls. Werewolves summon normal wolves to form large packs with them.

**Wereboar:** Wereboars are semi-intelligent and bad-tempered. In human form they often seem to be berserkers, and may act the same way in battle (gaining +2 on attack rolls and fighting to the death). Wereboars summon normal boars to help them in battle. Wereboars do not associate with devil swine.

**Weretiger:** These relatives of the great cats often act like them, being very curious but becoming dangerous when threatened. They are good swimmers and quiet trackers, surprising often (1-4 on 1d6). They can summon any type of great cat that is in the area (preferring tigers).

**Werebear:** Werebears are very intelligent, even in animal form. A werebear usually prefers to live alone or with bears. It might be friendly, however, if peacefully approached. In combat, werebears can hug for 2d8 points of damage (in addition to normal damage) if both paws hit the same target in one round. A werebear can summon any type of bear in the area.

### Uncommon Lycanthropes

**Werebat:** These dangerous flying creatures are sometimes confused with vampires, turning from human to bat form at will. In addition to summoning normal and giant bats, they can summon 1d4 other werebats (each of which can, in turn, summon other normal or giant bats, but not more werebats). Each werebat bite may inflict a nonmagical disease (of the DM's choice); the chance is 1 in 6, checked per bite.

**Werefox:** Where dense underbrush slows most normal movement to half or less, this creature can maintain full or two-thirds normal movement. It also normally has high intelligence, and thus often becomes a magic-user as well (though spells can be cast only when in human form). A werefox can also *charm* (persons in person form, animals in fox form) three times per day; however, this effect lasts for 24 hours at most.

**Wereshark:** These are mermen, inflicted with a form of lycanthropy that enables them to take the form of a mako shark anytime they choose so long as it is in darkness. When the moon is full

they must change into a shark and will maraud the seas. Under this forced change they lose their intelligence and become bloodthirsty killers. The only difference between a wereshark and a mako shark is that weresharks are intelligent and only magic or silver weapons will harm a wereshark. In island areas there are rumors of humans that are weresharks.

**Wereseal:** This unusual creature is only found near seacoasts of cold water. The more common female form (described) is not normally aggressive, but the rarer male (bull) seal can be quite dangerous (AC 3; HD 8\*; MV (same); Dmg 2d10; Save F8, ML 11, XPV 1,200). One bull seal is usually accompanied by 2d4 females.

**Devil Swine:** A devil swine appears as either a huge hog or a grossly fat human. Although it can change shape freely during the night, it must keep one shape throughout the daylight hours. Devil swine prefer the fringes of human settlements, especially those near swamps or forests. They are carnivorous, especially fond of human flesh, and will ambush if possible. Each devil swine can cast a *charm person* spell three times per day. It can use this spell in either human or swine form. A saving throw vs. spells is allowed, but with a -2 penalty to the roll. Each devil swine normally has 0-3 (1d4-1) humans under its control. They are unlike werewolves; being fat, pink and smooth-skinned, while werewolves have bristly, hairy hides.

*Terrain:* Variable, but often as animal type.

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Very Rare).

A malfera is a creature from the Dimension of Nightmares, where many evil dreams are bred and released into the minds of sleeping people. A malfera appears only through the acts of a powerful magic-user or an Immortal; its dimension is believed poisonous and deadly to humans.

The malfera has a large, elephantlike face and a short trunk. The head is topped by large horns. Large fangs protrude from either side of the trunk. The chest is a mass of slimy, short tentacles. Long, muscular arms end in large, jagged pincers. Its feet are webbed and clawed. It is colored night-black but has red veins and eyes.

In combat, a malfera attacks with pincers and bites. If both pincers hit the same target, the victim is dragged to the chest of the malfera on the next round. The tentacles then automatically

trap the victim. These tentacles are coated with an acid slime and do 2d6 points of damage each round. The victim can be freed only when the malfera is killed.

In addition, the breath of a malfera is poisonous. Each time it hits with a bite, its victim must save vs. poison (at a +3 bonus) or die. A malfera is immune to acid and can be struck only by magical weapons.

Aside from its combat abilities, a malfera can *detect invisible* and open all doors as if it had a *knock* spell. Because of its tough constitution and highly magical nature, it saves as a 13th level fighter.

*Terrain:* Any; Dimension of Nightmares.

### Manscorpion

|----------------|-----------------|

| 10**** = 3,700 | 13***** = 6,500 |

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

The manscorpion is an evil combination of man and arachnid. The upper body is like that of a human, but its lower parts are those of a giant scorpion (with stinging tail). It may be found in nearly any climate, but most frequently in deserts, mountains, and dungeons.

This arachnid warrior normally wields a huge pole arm (damage 3d6 points), but may use a long bow or any other weapon available. It may also strike with its dreaded deadly poisonous tail; the victim hit takes 1d10 points of damage, and must make a saving throw vs. poison or die. Even if the saving throw is successful, the victim is paralyzed for 0-7 rounds (1d8-1). Only victims immune to paralysis or poison can avoid this effect, so the monsters are greatly feared. They are immune to their own poison and to the poison of all scorpions.

Some (1 in 20) of the arachnid creatures are clerics, of 8th-13th level (with the corresponding added Hit Dice). However, these are normally found only in their lair.

Manscorpions are intelligent warlike beings whose main interests involve acquiring food and destroying creatures different from them. They do not make friends with other sentient races and make pets only of giant scorpions. They make raids on desert human communities for food and attack any living thing that ventures into their territories.

*Terrain:* Cavern, Desert, Mountain.

Manta rays are aquatic creatures, flat fish whose bodies are shaped like broad wings or sails. They flap their "wings" to propel them through the water. When a manta ray lies in the sand on the ocean floor it is completely invisible.

Normal Manta Ray: Normal manta rays can grow to be 7' in width and 12' in length. The tail on the manta ray has many sharp poisonous spines that can paralyze its victim. They attack with this tail. A saving throw vs. poison will prevent paralysis.

Giant Manta Ray: Giant manta rays can be up to about 40' in width and 75' in length. Beside the poisonous tail, they can also buffet (ram) a creature for 3d4 points of damage. They feed from the ocean floor and sometimes swallow treasure that has settled there.

**Terrain:** Ocean.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

A manticore is a horrid monster with the body of a lion, leathery bat wings, a tail ridged with spikes, and the face of a man with large, sharp fangs. It usually lives in wild mountain ranges.

The manticore has 24 tail spikes, and can shoot six each round even when flying (ranges 50/100/180). The creature regrows two spikes per day. Its favorite food is man.

Manticorecs frequently track humans, ambushing them with spike attacks when the human group stops to rest. Another tactic is to stalk its prey like a great cat, creeping up close on an unsuspecting victim. When that victim is alone, the manticore fires off a barrage of tail-spikes to bring the victim down. The manticore then eats the victim. Less frequently, a pack of manticorecs will stalk and attack a group of victims.

**Terrain:** Mountain.

**Load:** 3,000 cn at up to full speed, or 6,000 cn at up to half speed.

**Barding Multiplier:** x 2.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare). Planar Monster (Very Rare).

A medusa looks like a human female with live snakes growing from her head instead of hair. Medusae are very magical, and the mere sight of a medusa will turn a creature to stone unless the victim makes a saving throw vs. turn to stone. However, this will affect only one character per round, and characters may watch the reflection of a medusa in a mirror without danger. If a medusa sees her own reflection, she must make a saving throw vs. turn to stone or she will petrify herself!

In combat, the medusa makes one attack roll for the bites of the snakes, and if they hit, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison (in addition to taking 1d6 points of damage) or die in one turn. A medusa will often wear a robe with a hood for disguise so she can trick her victims into looking at her. Medusae occasionally use weapons.

Anyone who tries to attack a medusa without looking at her must subtract 4 from the attack roll, and the snakes may attack with a +2 bonus to the attack roll. A medusa also gains +2 on all saving throws vs. spells due to her magical nature.

Many medusae are evil. Others are reclusive scholars, ancient sages who can guide heroes on their quests and who conceal their deadly visages under veils.

There are also medusa spellcasters (see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter).

Medusae are native to both the Prime Plane and their original home, the elemental plane of Earth.

Plane of Earth: On the plane of Earth, a medusa is an ugly writhing mass of 10' long tentacles connected to a small lumpy spherical body. Several eyes on foot-long eyestalks also protrude from the body; the mouth has many teeth. The tentacles are used both for movement (180' (60')) and combat. The medusa can attack with 10 tentacles per round; each hit requires a saving throw vs. paralysis (lasting 2d4 rounds if failed). A paralyzed victim is drawn to the mouth and bitten for 2-16 (2d8) points of damage per round (no attack roll required while the victim is paralyzed).

**Elemental Plane of Earth Statistics:** AC 4, HD 8\*\*, MV 180' (60'), NA 1-4, Save F4, ML 9, TT(V) F, AL C, XP 1,750.

**Terrain:** Cavern, Ruins; Plane of Earth.

**Monster Type:** Construct, Enchanted (Very Rare).

Meks are huge (15'-25' tall) metallic creations, created by a long-dead race of inhuman insectile sorcerers. Those with masters generally serve as guards. Lone meks usually wander randomly, attacking most creatures they encounter.

Most meks resemble their creators, with insectlike features, barrel-like chests, and long, barbed, double-jointed arms and legs. However, meks resembling giants, lizards, and many other creatures have been encountered.

Each "normal" mek attacks by striking with its heavy limbs and breathing a paralyzing gas in a 20' diameter cloud around it. Each victim within the cloud must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon (each round) or be paralyzed for 1d3 turns.

Meks are not intelligent, but respond to simple verbal commands from their masters. A cold-based attack will slow a mek to half speed, but they are immune to all other spells except disintegrate.

**Terrain:** Any.

**Monster Type:** Human (Common).

Most groups of men are led by higher level leaders (with better armor, hit points, saving throws, and possibly magical items). Men usually have large camps. Most treasure is usually at the camp. There are other types of men (see also *Berserker, Headsman* (and *Thug*), *Mystic, Normal Human*).

**Brigand:** Brigands are loosely organized outlaws and renegade mercenaries who live by raiding towns and robbing caravans and travelers. Most belong to the fighter class. For every 20 brigands there is one additional 2nd level fighter who acts as their leader. For every 40 brigands there is an additional 4th level fighter acting as commander of the entire group.

Half of the brigands have leather armor, shield, short bow, and sword. The rest are mounted on riding horses, wear chain mail, and carry shields and swords. The leaders wear plate mail, carry swords and lances, and ride war horses with barding.

Brigands often band together in fortified camps of 50-300 men. A camp is always led by a 9th level fighter, with an additional 5th level fighter for every 50 brigands. There is also a 50% chance that a magic-user of level 9-11 is in the brigand camp, and a 30% chance that an 8th level cleric is in the brigand camp.

**Buccaneer (and Pirate):** Buccaneers are found on seas, rivers, great lakes, and oceans. They live by raiding coastal towns and capturing ships, selling the booty elsewhere. Most are Neutral fighters.

Pirates are seagoing men who plunder other vessels, raid coastal towns and engage in illegal slave trades. They are noted for their evil acts and cruelty toward prisoners. They also freely attack each other if there is a chance for profit. Most are Chaotic fighters.

The number of buccaneers or pirates that appear depends on the type and number of ships

they are sailing. Choose a type of ship to match the terrain. Buccaneers and pirates are organized as shown on the table.

| Ship           | No. of Ships | No. of Men per ship |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| River Boats    | 1-8          | 10-20               |
| Small Galley   | 1-6          | 20-40               |
| Long Ship      | 1-4          | 30-50               |
| Sailed Warship | 1-3          | 40-80               |

Buccaneer/Pirate Organization of Troops

| Weapons and Armor                                | Percent of Men |         |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------|
|                                                  | Buccaneers     | Pirates |
| Leather armor, sword                             | 60%            | 50%     |
| Leather armor, sword, crossbow                   | 30%            | 35%     |
| Chain mail, sword (if buccaneers, plus crossbow) | 10%            | 15%     |

For every 30 buccaneers, there is an additional 4th level fighter as leader. For every ship, there is a 7th level fighter as captain and a 9th level fighter as commander of the fleet. There is a 30% chance that a magic-user of level 10-11 is with the commander, and a 25% chance that an 8th level cleric is present.

For every 30 pirates, there is an additional 4th level fighter as leader. For every 50 pirates or 1 ship, there is a 5th level fighter captain. For every 100 pirates or 1 fleet, there is an 8th level fighter commander. For every fleet of 300 or more pirates, there is an 11th level fighter (Pirate Lord), as commander of the fleet, and a 75% chance for a 9th or 10th level magic-user.

Buccaneers and pirates may carry their treasure with them or have maps showing where it is buried. The treasure given is the total for the entire buccaneer pack or pirate fleet, and may be divided as desired. Pirates may also (25% chance) have 1d3 prisoners with them, awaiting ransom.

Well-defended coastal towns often serve as havens for pirates and buccaneers. These are lawless and dangerous places, full of possible adventures.

**Dervish:** Dervishes are desert raiders. About 90% are fighters; the rest are clerics. Dervishes often form camps or tribes of up to 300 men, led by a 10th level cleric. Such a camp will be either tents (75%) or a wooden or brick stockade (25%). These camps contain their women, children, livestock, and their treasure.

Dervishes are noted for their fanatic belief in their philosophies and their intolerance of other views. On rare occasions, they will wage a holy war in which they attempt to capture or kill all who have different beliefs. Captives are given an opportunity to convert; if they refuse, they may be killed or enslaved. Lawful characters may be invited to join the crusade, and those who refuse will be viewed with great suspicion unless a good reason can be provided as to why they should not participate.

**Noble:** This is a general term for any member of a social class of rulers. It does not apply to the family of a King or Queen (called Royalty). Traveling nobles encountered will normally be fighters, clad in fine plate mail armor and shield. Each noble fighter is always accompanied by a squire (2nd level fighter-servant), and may also have up to 12 retainers and hirelings of the DM's choice. Noble fighters may be escorting nonfighters who are traveling to some distant dominion.

The DM can create titles for nobles using the structure of the campaign as a guide. Some traditional titles are:

| Baron/Baroness | Emir   | Margrave |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| Count/Countess | Khan   | Sheik    |
| Duke/Duchess   | Knight |          |

Nomad: These groups of wandering tribesmen may be peaceful or warlike, and may have any alignment. Small bands encountered hunting or foraging in the wilderness are usually kept at the main camp. Nomads are keen traders and often have knowledge of faraway places, though they tend to be superstitious. Nomad bands are organized as shown.

## Organization of Desert Nomads

| Bow, leather armor, riding horse                       | 50%            |
| Bow, chain mail, riding horse                          | 20%            |
| Lance, chain mail and shield, riding or war horse      | 10%            |

For every 25 nomads, an additional 2nd level fighter leader is present. For every 40 nomads there is a 4th level fighter as leader. Nomad tribes may have up to 300 fighting men gathered together in a camp of temporary huts or tents. In addition to the leaders given above, there is one 5th level fighter for every 100 men and an 8th level fighter as the clan or tribe chief. At the main camp, there may (50% chance) be a 9th level cleric, and possibly (25%) an 8th level magic-user.

Trader: Traders are merchants who travel in caravans from town to town, buying and selling various goods (wines, silks, jewels, precious metals and the like). Those in the caravan usually ride horses, but they are likely to travel by camel in desert and barren lands and by mule in the mountains. All traders wear chain mail and carry a sword and dagger. Typical caravan organization is shown.

## Organization of Caravans

|           | Fighters | Extra |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Merchants | L1       | L2-L3 |
| Wagons    | L1       | L4-L5 |
| Animals   |          |       |
| 5         | 10       | 20    |
| 10        | 20       | 40    |
| 15        | 30       | 60    |
| 20        | 40       | 80    |
| 20        | 40       | 80    |
| 20        | 40       | 80    |

All fighters are AC 4, wielding swords, daggers, and crossbows. The extra animals may be horses, mules, or even camels. If a caravan has less than 20 wagons, the treasure should be reduced in proportion.

Terrain: By type:

| Brigand          | Any (wilderness)     |

| Buccaneer/Pirate | River/Lake, Ocean    |

**Monster Type:** Humanoid (Common).

Mermen are water-breathing humanoids. A merman has the upper body of a man and the lower body of a large fish. Mermen are armed with spears, tridents, or daggers. They live in coastal waters and hunt fish and harvest kelp. Except for leaders, all mermen have 1 Hit Die and save as 1st level fighters.

The number appearing represents a small hunting party, although mermen often form underwater villages of  $ext{ld}3 imes 100$  members. For every ten mermen encountered, there is an additional leader with 2 Hit Dice. For every 50 there is one leader with 4 Hit Dice. Mermen leaders save as fighters of a level equal to their Hit Dice.

Mermen often keep trained marine monsters and animals to help guard their homes.

Mermen are the people of the sea, and a DM can use them the same way as NPC humans. There can be merman spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters."

**Terrain:** Ocean.

| XP Value:      | 100                     |

**Monster Type:** Humanoid (Rare).

Metamorphs look very similar to humans, but have pointed ears and pure white eyes. They are closely related to humans but, as a species, are masters of the ancient art of shapeshifting. They are not lycanthropes, though they are sometimes mistaken for them.

A metamorph can shapeshift up to 11 times each day, but only into certain forms. Unlike the *polymorph self spell* effect, this nonmagical shapeshift gives the metamorph all the abilities of the new form; even special attacks (such as a skunk's spray) are gained. Metamorphs cannot take giant-sized or fantastic forms, but can take any normal nonmagical form.

The forms a metamorph can use each day are:

| Worm      | Insect     | Reptile   |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Leech     | Crustacean | Amphibian |
| Spider    | Mammal     | Fish      |
| Centipede | Bird       |           |

![Illustration of a merman fighting a large shark underwater.]()![](_page_193_Picture_28.jpeg)

For example, a metamorph can turn into a mammal once per day. One day he may choose to become a monkey, and the next day a wolf. Once a choice has been used, the metamorph cannot change into that choice any more than that day. Each shape shift lasts up to 1 hour, and the metamorph can assume normal form at any time.

Metamorphs have good relations with elves, halfings, and druids, but avoid most human settlements. They live in strongholds similar to those of demihumans, but with many differences, adapted to their special abilities. Most are Chaotic (though Neutral and Lawful ones do exist), but few are noticeably evil or good.

Iften or more are present, one will be a leader with 5 + 2 Hit Dice. As long as the leader is with the group, their morale is 10.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Common).

A minotaur is a large man-shaped creature with the head, hide and temperament of a bull. It is larger than human size (standing 7-9' tall) and eats humans. It will attack anything its size or smaller and will pursue as long as its prey is in sight.

Minotaurs are semi-intelligent and some use weapons, preferring a spear, club, or axe. When using weapons, minotaurs gain +2 to damage rolls due to their strength. On the round a minotaur uses a weapon, it cannot gore or bite. Minotaurs usually live in tunnels or mazes.

Minotaurs of greater-than-normal intelligence can be spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

Terrain: Cavern, Ruins.

### Mujina

| Armor Class:   | 4                  |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Hit Dice:      | 8*(M)              |

| Attacks:       | 2 weapon + special |
| Damage:        | 1d6 or by weapon   |
| No. Appearing: | 1d4 (1d4)          |
| Save As:       | F8                 |

| Alignment:     | Chaotic            |
| XP Value:      | 1,200              |

**Monster Type:** Monster (Very Rare).

A mujina, in its natural form, looks like a human except that it has no face. Where the eyes, nose, ears and mouth should be is nothing—the face is smooth like an egg. However, the mujina may create an illusion to give its face any appearance it wants. It most often poses as a typical human until it decides to attack.

A mujina is very strong and can handle any two-handed weapon (other than a lance, pole arm, or crossbow) in one hand. In combat it uses two weapons, one in each hand. It has the same chance to hit with either weapon.

A mujina can also cause its true (blank) face to appear at will. Any creature of five Hit Dice (levels) or less who sees the blank face automatically runs in fear for 1d3 rounds at three times its normal movement rate. Creatures who have more than five Hit Dice (or levels) must save vs. wands or also flee.

A mujina often joins a party of adventurers as a retainer fighter. It may serve faithfully for a long period, not revealing its true identity. However, if given the opportunity, it robs the party of as much as possible and then flees.

Mujinas can speak Common, the language of their kind, and their alignment tongue.

Mujinas are magical creatures created to plague the human race. Mujinas are all physically and emotionally identical, and filled with a hatred for any creatures who have individual traits. They especially hate humans, the most diverse and individual of species.

Terrain: Any, where humans are found.

### Mule

| Armor Class:   | 7                |
|----------------|------------------|
| Hit Dice:      | 2(L)             |

| Alignment:     | Neutral          |
| XP Value:      | 20               |

**Monster Type:** Normal Animal (Common).

A mule is a crossbreed between a horse and a donkey. Mules are stubborn, and if bothered or excited they may either bite or kick. Mules cannot be trained to attack, but will fight in their own defense.

Mules are very strong for their number of Hit Dice, and can carry great amounts of weight for their owners. They become somewhat more stubborn when loaded down enough that they move at half normal speed. Mules may be taken into dungeons, if allowed by the DM. If encountered alone in a dungeon, the mules may belong to an NPC party nearby.

Terrain: Any.

Load: 3,000 cn at up to full speed, or 6,000 cn at up to half speed.

### Mummy\*

| Armor Class:   | 3              |
|----------------|----------------|
| Hit Dice:      | 5 + 1** (M)    |
| Move:          | 60' (20')      |

| Alignment:     | Chaotic        |
| XP Value:      | 575            |

**Monster Type:** Undead, Enchanted (Rare).

Mummies are undead monsters; the carefully-prepared and bandage-swathed remains of long-dead nobles and guardians—who lurk near deserted ruins and tombs. Mummies are often created as guardians for these tombs; they, are charged with the task of killing anyone who breaks into the tomb, even if they must follow the trespassers to the very ends of the earth.

Every character seeing a mummy must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or stop, paralyzed with fear, until the mummy is out of sight. The touch of a mummy causes disease in addition to damage (no saving throw). This hideous rotting affliction prevents all magical healing, and slows normal healing to 10% of the normal rate. The disease lasts until magically cured.

Mummies can be damaged only by spells, fire, or magical weapons, all of which only do half damage. They are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells.

Terrain: Ruins.

**Monster Type:** Human (Rare).

Mystics are humans who rigorously follow a way of life involving a special discipline of meditation, study, and physical training. They live in special building complexes (called "cloisters" or "monasteries") located far from towns and common civilization. NPCs mystics are possible, otherwise, mystics will be encountered on a pilgrimage, mission, or adventure for their cloister.

Mystics are usually (75%) Lawful, although other alignments are represented. All are utterly devoted to mystic discipline. All their material goods are owned by the cloister, and loaned to individual mystics as needed.

Mystics are surprised only on a roll of 1. Mystics never wear armor of any type, nor protective devices (rings, cloaks, etc.). They may use potions or other magical items for certain situations. They are trained to use many weapons, but often do not carry them, as they have great combat skill with their bare hands.

breath, taking half damage unless the saving throw is made (indicating 1/4 damage).

All nightshades can use the following spell-like powers at will, one power per round: *charm person*, *invisibility*, *haste*, *confusion*, and *cloudkill* (all as if a 21st level magic-user); *darkness*, *hold person*, *cause disease*, *dispel magic*, and *finger of death* (as a 21st level cleric). The effects of these powers are all identical to the spell effects, but are produced by brief concentration alone, not requiring the usual spell casting words or gestures, and can be produced in total silence.

In addition, all nightshades can *detect magic* at will, and can read all languages and magical writings. If using one of its spell-like powers, a nightshade cannot attack physically during that round.

A nightshade can also summon other undead once each four hours, and often does so before attacking prey itself. To find the undead responding to the summons, roll 1d6:

| 1-3 | phantom (shade)       |
|-----|-----------------------|
| 4-5 | haunt (chaotic ghost) |
| 6   | spirit (hand druid)   |

If a cleric's attempt at turning a nightshade succeeds, the monster may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. If the saving throw is successful, the turn attempt is ignored; it has no effect, but is not counted as a failure, and the cleric may repeat the attempt if desired. Furthermore, the monster may make another saving throw for any "D" result that it does not avoid, and if successful, it is merely turned.

Each nightshade has other abilities as described below. In hand-to-hand combat, the touch of a nightshade is deadly poisonous, requiring an immediate saving throw vs. poison with a -2 penalty to the roll (in addition to normal damage).

Nightshades always carry treasure of great value, which they swallow and carry with them. They scorn coins, carrying only gems, jewelry, and magical treasures. They collect the treasures of their victims after every battle.

Nightcrawler: This appears similar to a purple worm, about 100' long and 10'-15' wide, but black in color. If it approaches from under an opponent, tunneling through rock, it surprises 50% of the time (unless the victims have met a nightshade before, recognizing the chilling approach of the creature).

A nightcrawler swallows its opponent if its attack roll is 19 or 20. A victim swallowed loses 1 level per round, due to energy drain (no saving throw; however, it does not affect anyone protected by a *protection from evil* spell effect). Normal bites inflict 2d10 points of damage (plus the usual saving throw vs. poison). Its dreaded tail stinger inflicts 2d4 points, requires the usual saving throw against the poison, and also has a 1 in 8 chance of killing the victim immediately (no saving throw, no adjustments; roll 1d8, and on a 1 the victim is dead).

A nightcrawler has the ability to magically shrink one opponent within 60', once per round. The victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect; if he fails this, the victim shrinks to 1' and the nightcrawler thereafter gains a +4 bonus to its attack roll against that opponent (thus swallowing on an attack roll of 15 or greater). The shrink effect is permanent until dispelled.

Nightwalker: This appears similar to a giant of some type, but jet black in color and without carried items, standing 20' tall. It attacks with two swings per round; these terrible blows cause 3d10 points of damage each, and every blow is deadly poison, as with all nightshades.

Each hit by a nightwalker has a 50% chance of crushing the victim's shield or armor. Apply this effect to shields first, and reduce the chance by 10% per magical "plus"—for example, a +5 or better shield cannot be destroyed in this way, a +4 shield has a 10% chance of being destroyed, etc. No saving throw is allowed, and weapons are not affected unless the monster actually picks them up. The creature may, however, automatically destroy any magical item or weapon it captures (from a fallen opponent, for example), by crushing it.

A nightwalker has the ability to *gaze* at one opponent per round, to a 60' range. The victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the gaze; if it is failed, the victim is cursed, suffering a -4 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws until the curse is removed. (A *dispel evil* spell will cancel the curse, but a remove curse spell will only work if cast by a 25th or higher level caster.)

Nightwing: This appears similar to a gigantic bat, solid black in color, with a 50' wingspread. Its first attack is normally a swoop downward, and its high speed gives it a 90% chance of surprising opponents (unless they have experience with nightshades, which negates surprise as explained above).

Any victim hit by a nightwing must make a saving throw vs. spells. If he fails this saving throw, the victim turns into a giant bat (see the *polymorph other* magic-user spell). Anyone turned into a bat is a servant of the nightwing (as if *charmed*) until the *polymorph* effect is dispelled.

A nightwing can attempt to hit a victim's items instead of causing physical damage. It will use this attack form if the victim damages it, or if the victim's defenses cause the nightwing to miss when attacking normally. This attack requires a normal attack roll but with a +4 bonus; if successful, the item is hit. The effect of such a strike drains one "plus" of magic from the item. It does not affect items without "plusses." A shield or weapon being held is the usual target. The stolen "plusses" can be restored by a *dispel evil* spell cast on the item affected, or by a *remove curse* spell from a 25th or higher level caster.

Terrain: Any.

### Nixie

| Alignment:     | Neutral     |
| XP Value:      | 13          |

**Monster Type:** Humanoid (Rare).

Nixies are 3'-tall water sprites. They look like small beautiful women, and their skin is light blue, green, or gray-green. They are part of the community of "forest folk," along with centaurs, dryads, actaeons, etc. Nixies dwell in rivers and lakes, making their lairs in the deepest part of the water.

Nixies avoid combat, but may try to *charm* an intruder. Ten nixies can together cast one such *charm*, and if the victim fails his saving throw, he enters the water and serves the nixies for a year. Each nixie can cast a *water breathing* spell on her slave, but this must be renewed every day.

If forced to fight, nixies use small tridents and daggers (weapons which do 1d4 damage), and each may summon a giant bass for aid (see *Fish, Giant*).

There can be nixie spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

**Terrain:** River/Lake.

### Normal Human

| Armor Class:   | 9          |
|----------------|------------|
| Hit Dice:      | 1-1 (M)    |

| Intelligence:  | 10         |
| Alignment:     | Any        |
| XP Value:      | 5          |

**Monster Type:** Human (Common).

"Normal human" is the game term for a human who does not seek adventure. A normal human does not have a character class, but might (optionally) have General Skills.

The DM should select, rather than roll, a normal human's hit points, according to the character's age, health, and profession (1-7 hit points). For example, a blacksmith could have 7 hit points, but a young child or sickly beggar might have only 1 hit point.

Most humans are "normal" humans and have little or no role in adventures. Some normal people belonging to specific professions or social classes (such as merchant, soldier, lord, scout, sage, healer, and so forth) are of help in some adventures. Soldiers and other fighting men will have higher morale.

Typical normal humans are peasants, children, housewives, workers, artists, villagers, townspeople, fishermen, and scholars (also, see the entry for *Men*).

**Terrain:** Settled.

| XP Value:      | Variable                         |

**Monster Type:** Human (Common).

An NPC party is any group of nonplayer characters. Each NPC may be of any class, level, and alignment. All rules for player characters apply to NPCs. An NPC party may be created in great detail before a game or created on the spot.

Most parties (whether NPCs or PCs) will not want to fight other parties, preferring monsters to challenge. The DM may wish to avoid the large, complicated battle that could occur between two parties. When PCs meet an NPC party, decide how the NPCs will react, or roll a reaction. Modify the roll if you choose (perhaps the NPCs have heard of the PC party, or are even familiar with them as allies, rivals, or enemies).

### NPC Reaction Table

| 2d6 Roll | NPC Reaction                     |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| 2-5      | Depart in Anger                  |
| 6-8      | Negotiate                        |
| 9-12     | Offer to buy or sell information |

The NPCs may offer to buy information about the dungeon or local area, for 1d100 X 5 gp, or to sell similar information (for the same price range). Typical information could be: monsters seen, traps found, stairs up or down, or other features. The DM should decide on the price offered by the NPCs, considering the value of the information sold.

**Creating NPC Parties:** Creating NPC parties in advance will save time. Choose the members of an NPC party or use random rolls, as follows.

1. Roll 1d6 + 3 to find the Number Appearing. (For ease of play, you can make the NPC party number equal to the PC party number, plus 1d4 fighters.)
2. Determine the class of each by rolling 1d20, then roll 1d6 adding the modifiers given to find the level:

| 1d20  | Class      | Level        |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| 1-3   | cleric     | 4-9 (1d6+3)  |
| 4     | druid      | 3-8 (1d6+2)  |
| 5-6   | dwarf      | 7-12 (1d6+6) |
| 7-8   | elf        | 3-8 (1d6+2)  |
| 9-11  | fighter    | 4-9 (1d6+3)  |
| 12    | halfing    | 3-8 (1d6+2)  |
| 13-15 | magic-user | 4-9 (1d6+3)  |
| 16    | mythic     | 3-8 (1d6+2)  |
| 17-18 | thief      | 5-10 (1d6+4) |
| 19-20 | fighter    | 6-11 (1d6+5) |

1. Determine alignment of each NPC with 1d6: 1-3 = Lawful; 4-5 = Neutral; 6 = Chaotic. (Druids can only be Neutral.)
2. Choose or randomly determine the spells of any spellcasters in the party.

1. Choose or randomly determine the magical items carried by the NPCs (see below).
2. Decide on the NPC marching order.

If encountered in the wilderness, there is a 75% chance that the NPC party will be mounted. In general, NPCs should have about the same amount of equipment as a PC of the same level. Magic may be assigned or determined randomly. The chance of any NPC of 1st level or greater possessing magical items is 5% per level (maximum chance 95%), checking on each magical item suitable:

- Swords
- Scroll
- Armor
- Wand/Staff/Rod
- Potion
- Miscellaneous Magic
- Other Weapons

If an NPC cannot use an item, the NPC should not have it (do not re-roll). Change any magical items if desired. NPCs will use their magic if combat begins. Players should not obtain magical items from NPCs except through barter, trickery, or force.

*Terrain:* Any, including other planes.

### Nuckalavee

| XP Value:      | 3,500              |

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

The evil, amphibious nuckalavee is a relative of the centaur. It is shaped similarly but has an enlarged, hideous head. The creature's skin is transparent, and the resulting appearance (visible white ropy muscles, yellow veins, and black blood) is quite horrible.

The nuckalavee is immune to fire and poison, and regenerates 3 points per round. However, it cannot cross flowing fresh water.

A nuckalavee radiates fear in a 50' radius; each creature within the area must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or flee for 2d6 rounds. The saving throw must be made each round that an opponent remains in the area.

The monster's very presence slays all normal insects and other small creatures with 2 hit points or less, at a 120' range. Any victim hit by its claw attack must make a saving throw vs. death ray or die. The monster breathes a cone of cold once every three rounds, 60' long and 10' wide at the base, inflicting the creature's current hit points in damage; each victim may make a saving throw vs. dragon breath to take half damage.

Nuckalavee are friendly with all types of undead. They can speak freely with them, and undead do not attack nuckalavee unless rigidly controlled.

There can be nuckalavee spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

**Monster Type:** Lowlife (Common).

An ochre jelly is an ochre-colored giant amoeba that can be harmed only by fire or cold. It can seep through small cracks, and destroy wood, leather, and cloth in 1 round, but cannot eat through metal or stone. Attacks with weapons or lightning merely make 1d4 + 1 smaller (2 Hit Dice) ochre jellies. A normal ochre jelly causes 2d6 points of damage per round to exposed flesh. Smaller ochre jellies inflict only half damage.

**Monster Type:** Humanoid (Common).

Ogres are huge fearsome humanlike creatures, usually 8' to 10' tall. They wear animal skins for clothes, and often live in caves. They are very primitive and greedy; they hunt animals when they have to, but are just as content to ambush travelers or bully them into surrendering food and money instead. When encountered outside their lair, a group of ogres will be carrying 1d6 x 100 gp in large sacks. Ogres hate neanderthals and will attack them on sight.

Ogres have no special combat tactics. When inclined to fight, they will beat their prey with large clubs until it stops moving or the ogres fail a morale check and flee.

Ogres of greater than normal intelligence can be spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

*Monster Type:* Humanoid (Common).

An orc is an ugly humanlike creature, and looks like a combination of animal and man. Most orcs are shaped like humans, but many have bestial facial features and teeth.

Orcs are nocturnal omnivores, and prefer to live underground. When fighting in daylight, they have a penalty of -1 on their attack rolls. Orcs have bad tempers and do not like other living things.

One member of each group of orcs is a leader

with 8 hit points who gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls. If this leader is killed, the morale of the group becomes 6 instead of 8. Orcs are afraid of anything larger or stronger than they are, but may be forced to fight by their leaders.

Orcs are often used for armies by Chaotic leaders (both humans and monsters). They prefer swords, spears, axes, and clubs for weapons. They cannot use mechanical weapons (such as catapults), and only their leaders understand how to operate such devices.

There are many different tribes of orcs. Each tribe has as many female orcs as males, and at least two children ("whelps") for each two adults. The leader of an orc tribe is a chieftain with 15 hit points, who attacks as a 4 Hit Dice monster and gains +2 on damage rolls. For every 20 orcs in a tribe, there may be an ogre with them (1 in 6 chance). There is a 1 in 10 chance of an allied troll living in the lair as well.

There can be orc spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

*Monster Type:* Monster (Common).

An owl bear is a huge bearlike creature with the head of a giant owl. The creature is furry from the feet to the neck, at which point fur gives way to feathers. It stands 8' tall and weighs 15,000 cn (1,500 pounds). Owl bears are commonly found underground and in dense forests.

They have nasty tempers, are carnivores, and are usually hungry, preferring meat. If both its paws hit one opponent in one round, the owl bear hugs for an additional 2d8 points of damage.

*DM Checklist:*

Attacks: Sight = fear; Special for each

Defenses: Ethereal at first; saving throw vs. turning (spells); magical weapon to hit

*Monster Type:* Undead, Enchanted (Rare).

Phantoms are undead beings which lurk nearly anywhere. They avoid sunlight, but are not bothered by magical light sources. They are immune to all *charms* and cold spells, and can only be damaged by magical weapons.

*Ethereal form:* When first encountered, a phantom is always in nonmaterial form, and (though it can be turned) cannot be damaged at all from the Prime Plane. Each phantom has a special attack form, given in the description, which it normally uses immediately. The phantom then materializes for physical combat, becoming AC 0.

*Fear:* Everyone seeing a phantom (within 120') must make a saving throw vs. spells or run away in fear. Creatures of 3 Hit Dice or less are automatically affected (no saving throw) and will utterly refuse to return to the area in which the phantom was seen. Other creatures are unaffected if the saving throw is successful.

*Turning:* All phantoms are resistant to turning by clerics. "D" results are handled normally, but if a "T" result occurs, the phantom may make a

saving throw vs. spells; if successful, the turn effect is reflected back onto the cleric, who must also make a saving throw vs. spells or be paralyzed with fear for 2d6 rounds.

Each phantom keeps the treasure of its victims. The apparition and shade keep their treasures in some area near where they are encountered, but a vision's treasure will appear in the area if the vision is destroyed.

*Apparition:* This is a single humanoid creature, appearing much like a wight but semi-transparent. It is always seen standing in a clear area when first encountered, and never uses any weapons. An apparition's first attack is the creation of a swirling semi-transparent mist, 10' high with a 20' radius. All within the mist must make a saving throw vs. spells or be *entranced*, unable to do anything but watch the mist until it disappears. Those remaining within the swirling mist must make the saving throw each round. The mist lasts for 12 rounds, or until the creature is destroyed or turned. When the entrancing effect wears off, a victim need not make any further saving throws against the mist. The mist will move with the creature.

After *entrancing* at least one victim, the apparition materializes and rakes the victim with both bony claws (+4 bonus to attack rolls, dam-

# Chapter 14: Monsters

age  $1d6 + 2$  points per claw). An apparition rarely attacks moving victims, trying to slay at least one victim per encounter.

Any human or demihuman slain by an apparition will become one in one week; the only way to avoid this fate is to cast a *dispel evil* spell on the body before casting a *raise dead* (all within the week's time). If a *raise dead* is cast without the *dispel evil*, the character will revive, apparently none the worse for the experience—but will begin to fade a week later, turning into an apparition.

Shade: Similar to an apparition, this creature looks like a single humanoid, but always carries a dagger. It surprises its victims 90% of the time, normally moving through a wall or door when first encountered. It moves quickly toward one target, threatening with its weapon; the victim must make a saving throw vs. death ray or immediately fall dead in horror.

After this initial attack, the shade materializes and viciously slashes any nearby victims with its dagger. If seriously endangered or if morale fails, it will dematerialize and flee. Unlike other phantoms, a shade always inhabits indoor or underground areas.

Vision: Quite different from other phantoms, a vision always inhabits a specific area of no greater than 500 square feet. The vision is of 2d4 humanoid, rather than a single one, and most have weapons and armor of various types. A vision often looks like the remains of a fierce battle with no survivors. The vision is actually a collection of lost souls.

When first encountered, all the souls start to cry and howl. All within 90' hearing the noise must make a saving throw vs. spells. All those failing the saving throw are filled with sorrow and sympathy for the souls in the vision; they will believe all action is hopeless, and sit down and cry for the lost souls for 11-20 rounds ( $1d10 + 10$ ). Those within range must continue to make one saving throw each round.

After crying out for  $1d3$  rounds, the creatures in the vision start to rise (materializing) and attack, continuing their awful wailing. No single individual has any hit points; the vision as a whole has 12 Hit Dice, and all damage inflicted on all individuals is counted against that total. The vision attacks once per individual phantom within it, each individual attacking as a 12 HD monster and inflicting  $1d8$  points of damage per hit. (Each is typically armed with a normal sword; the DM may equip the phantoms otherwise, using the appropriate damage by weapon type. However, no magical weapons or other magical items will be used.) Within their restricted area, phantoms of a vision move at 40' per round.

If a vision is successfully turned, it disappears for  $1d6$  hours before returning; it cannot move away from the given location. All individual phantoms in a vision are confined within the area, and cannot pursue or evade.

Terrain: Ruins.

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Very Rare).

The phoenix is a native of the elemental plane of Fire, and has the appearance of a large red-orange eagle surrounded by intense flames. On the Prime Plane it is quite rare, but may be found in any climate. It is never hostile unless attacked, and is never found underground.

The phoenix is immune to all forms of fire, all *charm* and *hold* spells, and to weapons of less than +3 enchantment.

In combat, a phoenix attacks with its claws and beak. All opponents within its flames take fire damage per round, regardless of protections (phoenix flame is different from all other types of fire). When a phoenix is slain or destroyed, it disappears with an explosion of fire in a 20' radius (as a *fireball*); each victim may make a saving throw vs. dragon breath to take half damage, but again, protections from fire do not apply. The phoenix reappears from its ashes 1 round later, whole and fully cured, and will immediately flee from its attackers.

Except for a *wish*, there is no known way to permanently destroy a phoenix, and its method of reproduction is unknown.

Lesser phoenix: This creature has a 10' wingspread and stands 5' tall. It radiates fire in a 10' radius, inflicting 3d6 points per round. Its explosion inflicts  $1d10 \times 5$  points of damage. Claw damage is 1d6 points each; beak damage is 2d6 points.

Greater phoenix: This creature has a 25' wingspread and stands 10' tall. It radiates fire in a 20' radius, inflicting 6d6 points per round. Its explosion inflicts  $10 \times 10$  points of damage. Claw damage is 2d6 points each; beak damage is 4d6 points.

Phoenix feathers can be used to make a *potion of phoenix fire resistance*, which bestows total immunity to normal and magical fire, reduces damage from fire-type breath weapons to half (saving throw for one-quarter), and acts as a normal *potion of fire resistance* against phoenix fire. One feather can be recovered each time a phoenix is slain. Three feathers from a lesser phoenix (worth 10,000 gp each) are required to make the potion, or one feather from a greater phoenix (worth 25,000gp).

Terrain: Any; Plane of Fire.

**Monster Type:** Humanoid (Rare).

Pixies are small humanlike creatures with insectlike wings. They are distantly related to elves, but are only 1'-2' tall. They are invisible unless they want to be seen (or unless magically detected).

Pixies do not suffer the limitations of the *invisibility* spell—they can attack and remain invisible, and they always gain surprise when doing so. They may not be attacked in the first round of combat, but after that their attackers will see shadows and movement in the air and may attack the pixies with a -4 penalty on attack rolls.

Their small insectlike wings can only support pixies for three turns, and they must rest one full turn after flying.

Pixies have their own communities in the wilderness. They do not attack humans except when they are themselves attacked or endangered. They may do favors for polite adventurers; they know much of the wilderness and can guide heroes to lost cities or hidden caverns.

There can be pixie spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Rare).

A plasm looks like a human- or giant-sized skeleton made of elemental matter.

There are four types of plasms, one of each element. A plasm is made of a combination of elemental material and ectoplasm (solid ether). It cannot safely exist on any plane except the Ethereal, and is sometimes encountered within a wormhole. On any plane except the Ethereal, a plasm automatically loses 1 Hit Die per round from energy drain, vanishing when dead.

A plasm feeds on its element, and regenerates damage when feeding at the rate of 1 point per round. Any magical attack based on its element

## Chapter 14: Monsters

will cause a plasm to gain Hit Dice and hit points. For example, a *fireball* cast at a fire plasm by a 9th level magic-user would cause it to immediately gain 9 additional Hit Dice (9d8 hit points).

Plasms are immune to poison and normal weapons, and are only slightly damaged by magical weapons. Each blow from a magical weapon inflicts only its magic damage ("plusses"), ignoring normal weapon damage and strength bonuses. For example, a *sword* +4 would inflict 4 points of damage on a plasm.

A plasm can only be damaged by magical weapons (as given above) and by attack forms based on elemental dominance.

Once per turn, a plasm can "spend" 10 of its hit points to create an acid cloud based on its element. This cloud is a 30' diameter sphere, which inflicts 20 points of damage to all within it (except the plasm); each victim may make a saving throw vs. dragon breath to take half damage. The cloud lasts for 1d6 rounds. A plasm normally saves this attack form to use when fleeing.

Terrain: Ethereal Plane, Wormholes (only).

Monster Type: Prehistoric Animal (Very Rare).

These are hollow-boned flying and gliding reptiles. They have long beaks filled with numerous teeth, and reptilian arm structures with skin webbing which constitutes their wings.

Small Pterosaur (Pterodactyl): These are batlike reptiles with wingspans of 8-10 feet. They hunt insects, birds, and small animals, gliding slowly along air currents to spot their prey. If driven by great hunger, they may attack human-sized creatures.

Medium Pterosaur (Pteranodon): Pteranodons are much larger and more aggressive. They

have a wingspan of up to 50'. They will often attack and carry off man-sized creatures.

Large Pterosaur: Large pterosaurs have a wingspan of over 50 feet. If they attack with surprise, they will make a swoop attack for double damage. They can carry off a creature as large as a warhorse.

Terrain: Small, Medium: Hill, Mountain, Jungle (prehistoric). Large: Mountain (prehistoric).

Load: A pteranodon can carry 2,000 cn at full speed; 3,000 at half speed. A large pterosaur can carry 4,000 cn at full speed; 8,000 cn at half speed.

Monster Type: Lowlife (Very Rare).

Purple worms are huge, slime-covered creatures over 100' long and 8' to 10' in diameter. These monsters tunnel through the earth, burrowing up from the ground to feed on surface-

dwelling creatures.

They attack by biting and stinging with their tails. If the attack roll for the bite is 4 or more greater than the number required (or a 20, in any case), they can swallow creatures (man-size or smaller) whole; swallowed victims take 3d6 points of damage each round thereafter. A victim stung by the tail must make a saving throw vs. poison or die.

Note that if purple worms are encountered underground, the size of underground tunnels may prevent the creature from using one of its attacks. If it approaches by tunneling, it may surprise the victim (1 in 4 chance), but 1d4 + 1 rounds will pass before its tail is dragged free of the burrow.

Terrain: Cavern, Ruins, Swamp, Woods (dense).

Monster Type: Normal Rat: Normal Animal (Common). Giant Rat: Giant Animal (Common).

Rats are clever rodents that can eat meat, grain, sawdust, almost anything. Rats usually avoid humans and will not attack unless summoned (by a wererat, for example) or defending their lair. Rats are good swimmers and may attack while in water. They are afraid of fire, and will run from it unless forced to fight by a summoning creature.

Some rats carry diseases. Anyone bitten by a rat has a 1 in 20 chance of being infected. (This chance should be checked each time a rat successfully hits. If a rat is diseased, its XP award is 6.) The victim may still avoid the disease by making a saving throw vs. poison. If failed, the victim may die in 1d6 days (1 in 4 chance) or may

be sick in bed for 1 month, unable to adventure. Normal Rats: Normal rats have gray or brown fur, and are from 6" to 2" long. They attack in "packs" of 5-10 rats per pack. If there are more than 10 rats they will divide into packs of 10 or less and attack several creatures; one pack will only attack one creature at a time and makes one attack per round. Rats climb all over the creature they are attacking, often knocking the victim down.

Giant Rats: These creatures are very similar to the normal varieties, but are 3' long or more, and have gray or black fur. They are often found in dark corners of dungeon rooms and in areas with undead monsters.

Terrain: Normal Rats: Any. Giant Rats: Cavern, Ruins.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

This monster appears as a human figure with skeletal hands and a skull head with flowing, white hair. A revener prowls dark, underground caverns and dust-filled tombs and crypts. When it touches a victim, it drains one of the victim's senses permanently; the victim may make a saving throw vs. spells, success indicating that the loss is temporary (lasting only 2d6 rounds). The lost sense may be chosen or randomly determined; subsequent hits always drain different senses. A *restore* spell will restore one lost sense.

**Taste:** Victim cannot identify tastes (such as potions).

**Smell:** Victim is immune to vile odor effects, but suffers a -1 penalty to surprise rolls.

**Hearing:** Victim cannot hear and loses the ability to speak clearly (may ruin spell casting).

**Touch:** Victim's Dexterity drops by 4 points (and, if an elf, cannot find secret doors).

**Sight:** Victim is blinded.

**Smell:** Sense: Victim may not use ESP, *crystal balls*, *telepathy* or similar extra-sensory magical effects.

**Terrain:** Ruins.

**Monster Type:** Lowlife (Rare).

A rhagodessa is a giant spiderlike carnivore, about the size of a small horse. It has an oversized head and jaws (mandibles) colored yellow, and a dark brown thorax. It has five pairs of legs; the front pair end in suckers which help the creature grasp its prey. A hit with a leg does no damage but means that the victim is stuck. In the next round of combat, the victim is pulled to the mandibles and bitten (automatic hit).

Rhagodessas are nocturnal carnivores, hunting only in the dark. They are normally found in caves, and can climb walls.

**Terrain:** Cavern, Ruins; Hill, Mountain, Woods, (after dark).

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

Rocs are huge birds of prey resembling eagles. They are very lawful, and are often unfriendly toward neutrals (-1 on reaction rolls) and chaotics (-2 on reactions).

Rocs prefer solitude and will swoop to attack any intruders unless carefully approached. Their nests are in the highest mountains, and may (50% chance) contain 1d6 eggs or young. Rocs

**Monster Type:** Lowlife (Rare).

A robber fly is a 3' long giant fly with black and yellow stripes. From a distance, robber flies look like giant bees. They are carnivores, and may attack adventurers. However, they prefer giant bees as food, and are immune to their poison.

Robber flies are patient hunters. They often hide in shadows and wait to surprise prey (1-4 on 1d6). A robber fly can leap up to 30' and attack with its bite.

**Terrain:** Open, Ruins, Woods.

## Rust Monster

| Armor Class:   | 2          |
|----------------|------------|
| Hit Dice:      | 5* (L)     |
| Move:          | 120' (40') |
| Attacks:       | 1          |
| Damage:        | See below  |
| No. Appearing: | 1d4 (1d4)  |
| Save As:       | F3         |
| Morale:        | 7          |
| Treasure Type: | Nil        |
| Intelligence:  | 2          |
| Alignment:     | Neutral    |
| XP Value:      | 300        |

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

A rust monster has a body like a giant armadillo with a long tail, and two long front antennae. If a rust monster hits a target with its antenna, any nonmagical metal armor or weapon hit immediately crumbles to rust.

A rust monster is attracted by the smell of metal, and eats the rust created by its attacks. The rust monster can be hit by any type of weapon. A successful attack roll indicates that the rust monster's body is hit, which does not harm the weapon. A magical piece of metal struck usually loses one "plus" per hit, but has a 10% chance per "plus" of resisting the effect. For example, a *shield* + 1 has a 10% chance of surviving the attack.

**Terrain:** Cavern, Ruins.

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Very Rare).

Salamanders are free-willed beings from the elemental planes, common there but rare elsewhere. Both look like giant lizards; flame salamanders are from the plane of Fire, and frost salamanders are from the plane of Air. The two types are mortal enemies, and will attack each other on sight. Both are immune to normal weapons.

**Flame salamander:** This monster is a snakelike lizard, 12'-16' long, with bright orange-yellow and orange-red scales. When not on its own plane, it prefers to live in or near volcanoes, or in very hot lands. It is immune to fire. All creatures within 20' take 1d8 points of damage per round from the intense heat radiated by the creature.

Frost salamander: This monster has six legs and white or blue-white scales. When not on its own plane, it prefers frozen wastelands, glaciers, and icy tundra. It attacks by rearing up, striking with four legs plus one bite. It is immune to cold. All creatures within 20' take 1d8 points of damage each round from the extreme cold the monster radiates.

**Terrain:** Flame: Plane of Fire. Frost: Plane of Air.

**Monster Type:** Humanoid (Rare).

The sasquatch are a very shy race of low intelligence who dwell deep within dark woods and in high mountains. The creature is a tall ape-like creature with a crested head, large feet, and a thick mat of hair (dark brown in woods, white in mountains). It is omnivorous, occasionally slaying animal prey but usually eating plants and berries.

Although not aggressive, it will defend itself and its cavern lair ferociously (morale 11), attacking with clublike fists. In combat, it can also throw boulders to a 50' range (damage 2d8 points). Also, if both hands hit one victim, the sasquatch hugs for an additional 4d6 points of damage.

Common names for sasquatch include "Big-foot" (the woodland variety) and "Yeti" or "Abominable Snowman" (the mountain folk). Snow apes (q.v.) are also often called by the latter two names.

There can be sasquatch spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

**Terrain:** Mountain, Woods.

**Monster Type:** Lowlife (Rare).

A giant scorpion looks just like the normal arachnid, but is the size of a small horse. It lives in deserts, caves, and ruins, preying on any animal over 2' in length. It usually attacks on sight.

It fights by grasping a victim with its claws and stinging. If either claw hits, the attack roll for the stinger gains a +2 bonus. Anyone struck by the stinger must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or die.

**Terrain:** Cavern, Desert, Ruins.

### Shade

**Monster Type:** Monster, Enchanted (Rare). This monster is not undead.

Shadows are noncorporeal (ghostlike) intelligent creatures found in eerie, dark places such as dungeons, deep forests, or ruins. They can only be harmed by magical weapons. They look like real shadows and can alter their shape slightly. Shadows are hard to see and usually gain surprise (1-5 on 1d6).

If a shadow scores a hit, it will drain 1 point of Strength in addition to doing normal damage. This weakness will last for 8 turns. Any creature whose Strength is reduced to zero becomes a shadow immediately. Shadows are not affected by sleep or charm spells, but they are not undead and cannot be turned by clerics.

**Terrain:** Ruins, Woods.

**Monster Type:** Normal Animal (Common). Great White: Normal Animal (Rare).

Sharks are predators, feeding mostly on fish. They have little intelligence and are unpredictable. They are attracted to the scent of blood within 300' and it will drive them into a feeding frenzy (they attack but make no morale checks). Sharks are found in salt water.

Bull Shark: These are 8' long and brown in color. Bull sharks will ram their prey first to stun it (save vs. paralysis or be stunned for three rounds), and then attack the helpless prey the next round.

Mako Shark: These are 12' long and blue-gray or tan in color. Mako sharks are very unpredictable, ignoring prey one moment and attacking another.

Great White Shark: These are 30' long or larger and gray with a white underside. They have been known to destroy small boats.

**Terrain:** Ocean.

**Monster Type:** Giant Animal (Rare).

Giant shrews look like large, brown-furred rats with long snouts. They can burrow, climb, or jump (up to 5'). The eyes of a giant shrew are so weak that the creature is not affected by light or the lack of it. A shrew uses radarlike squeaks to "see" its surroundings (as bats do), and can "see" things within 60' as well as a creature with normal sight. Since it needs echoes to "see," a giant shrew dislikes open areas, and remains underground most of the time. A silence 15' radius spell will "blind" a giant shrew. If it cannot hear, it will be confused, and then becomes AC 8, with a penalty of -4 on its attack rolls.

A giant shrew is very quick and will always take the initiative on its first attack. It also gains a +1 bonus on its initiative roll for the remaining rounds of combat. Its attack is so ferocious (attacking the head and shoulders of the defender) that any victim of 3 Hit Dice (3rd level) or less must make a saving throw vs. death ray or run away in fear.

Shrews only eat insects and vegetable matter, but they are so nervous and aggressive that they are likely to attack anything that comes within 20' of them.

**Terrain:** Open, Ruins, Woods.

**Monster Type:** Lowlife (Common).

Shriekers look like giant mushrooms. They live in underground caverns and are able to move around slowly. They react to light (within 60') and movement (within 30') by emitting a piercing shriek which lasts for 1d3 rounds. For each round of shrieking, the DM can roll 1d6; any result of 4-6 indicates that a wandering monster has heard the noise, and will arrive in 2d6 rounds.

Their shriek can stun small animals (especially birds and bats), which the shriekers slowly crawl over to and draw into their feeding orifices, on the bottom of their "stalks." They are also scavengers, feeding off carrion left in their vicinity.

**Terrain:** Cavern, Ruins.

**Monster Type:** Undead, Enchanted (Common).

Animated skeletons are undead creatures often used as guards by the high level magic-user or cleric who animated them, or by greater undead creatures who command them. Skeletons are often found near graveyards, dungeons, and other deserted places. Since they are undead, they can be turned by clerics, and are not affected by *sleep* or charm *spells*, nor any form of mind reading. Skeletons will always fight until "killed."

**Monster Type:** Normal Animal (Common).

Snakes are long, sinuous, legless reptiles. They come in two varieties: constrictors and vipers. Constrictors wrap around their prey and squeeze it to death (they can bite, too, for some damage); vipers bite their prey and inject poison. Snakes are found almost everywhere, avoiding only very cold places. Most snakes do not usually attack unless surprised or threatened. Most snakes are carnivores but prefer prey small enough for them to eat; when dining, they unhinge their jaws and swallow their prey whole.

**Spitting Cobra:** A spitting cobra is a 3' long grayish-white snake. It spits a stream of venom at its victim's eyes, up to a distance of 6' away. If the spit hits, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or be blinded. (This blindness can normally be removed only by a *curse blindness* spell, but the DM may allow other methods.) As with most small poisonous snakes, a spitting cobra will not attack human-sized or larger opponents unless startled or threatened. It can either spit or bite in one round, but not

**Monster Type:** Giant Animal (Rare).

The giant slug is a huge boneless creature that dwells in underground caverns and dungeons. Its rubbery body allows it to squeeze through any opening 5' x 5' or larger. Because of its elasticity, attackers do not get to count strength bonuses when attacking them, blunt weapons inflict only magic damage (if not magical, they

do no damage at all), and edged weapons inflict only half damage (plus magic adjustment). Furthermore, a fighter's Smash option inflicts no additional damage.

The giant slug can attack with its sharp tongue (which does Id12 damage), but prefers to spit acid. Their ranged acid attack can fly to a 5' range per Hit Die (45' at 9 Hit Dice, etc.). The first such attack will always miss (the slug uses it to range in on victims), but following attacks are calculated normally.

Any victim hit by the acid takes damage equal to the slug's current hit points (a victim may make a saving throw vs. dragon breath to take half damage). The acid may also destroy equipment carried if the saving throw is failed. Giant slugs have been found with up to 20\*\* Hit Dice.

**Giant Snail:** The giant snail, found in deep forests, has a great shell that gives it AC -2; it is otherwise identical to the giant slug. The shell of a giant snail can be crafted into shields that bestow resistance to acid attacks (the user gains a +4 bonus to all saving throws against acid, including black dragon breath).

*Terrain:* Giant Slug: Cavern, Ruins. Giant Snail: Woods.

both; it will usually spit. The damage given (Id3 points) applies only to the bite; in this case, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in Id10 turns.

**Giant Racer:** This is an "average" type of giant snake about 4' long. It has no special abilities, but is faster than most other types. It is not poisonous, but its bite can be dangerous in itself. Larger ones may be found, averaging 2' long per Hit Die and inflicting Id8, Id10, or even 2d6 points of damage per bite.

**Pit Viper:** A pit viper is a 5' long greenish-gray poisonous snake with small pits in its head. These pits act as heat sensors, with a range of 60'. The combination of pits and infraction makes it very hard to fight a pit viper; it is so quick that it always gains the initiative (no roll needed). Any victim bitten by a pit viper must make a saving throw vs. poison or die.

**Sea Snake:** Sea snakes are snakes adapted for living in the sea. All are poisonous. They average 6' long, but can be much larger if the DM desires (2' long per Hit Die). A sea snake's bite is little

more than a pinprick, and will go unnoticed 50% of the time. The victim must make a saving throw vs. poison, and the poison is slow-acting; its full effects take Id4 + 2 turns to be felt if the saving throw is failed. Unlike other snakes, sea snakes will attack humans; they are very aggressive.

**Giant Rattlesnake:** A giant rattlesnake is a 10' long snake with brown and white scales set in a diamond pattern. On its tail is a dried, scaly rattle, which it often shakes to warn off intruders or attackers who are too large to eat. The victim of a giant rattlesnake bite must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in Id6 turns. This snake is very fast, and attacks twice per round, the second attack coming at the end of the round.

**Rock Python:** This 30' long snake has brown and yellow scales set in a spiral pattern. Its first attack is a bite. If the bite is successful, it coils around the victim and constricts in the same round. This squeezing does 2d4 points of damage per round, and occurs automatically until the snake dies or releases the victim.

*Terrain:* Any except Arctic. Sea Snake: Ocean.

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Very Rare).

Spectral hounds are creatures from the Dimensional Vortex—the void between all dimensions. In this world they appear as ghostly dogs—pale in color and translucent. Their eyes are formless pools of utter blackness. They are excellent trackers and once on the trail of a creature, they follow it for days. They are bred and trained by interplanar beings (such as elemental rulers, amirs, pashas, etc.) as hunting animals, and are sometimes used to track intrusive adventurers back to their home planes. Likewise, adventurers might be able to *charm* spectral hounds and train them to track villains through the planes. Spectral hounds never come to the Prime Plane except when being used in this manner by greater powers.

In combat, a spectral hound attacks by biting. Any character bitten by a spectral hound must save vs. spells. If he saves, the character suffers only the 2d6 points of damage from the bite, if he fails to save, he begins to fade. This fading is very gradual: In 24 hours the character has faded to the same translucent appearance as a spectral hound. The character's equipment is not affected. When the character finishes fading completely, he is unable to hold any normal items. He is unable to hear or talk to unaffected characters. From the faded character's point of view, all normal things appear translucent, while faded things (i.e. the spectral hounds and other affected characters) seem solid and normal.

At any time after a character has been affected, he may be restored to the normal world by a *dimension door* spell. When the spell is cast, the affected character or characters can step through the dimension door and return to the normal world.

Spectral hounds may be struck by silver or magical weapons, but not by normal weapons. They are immune to fire- and cold-based spells.

**Terrain:** Any; including all dimensional planes.

**Monster Type:** Undead, Enchanted (Rare).

The ghostly spectres are among the mightiest of the undead. They have no solid bodies; they appear as translucent beings of evil expression, their eyes fiery and red or black and featureless. Once human or demihuman, they have risen after death to do evil. They are often used as lieutenants by greater evil powers.

They can only be hit by magical weapons; silver weapons have no effect. Like all undead, spectres are immune to *sleep*, *charm*, and *hold* spells.

A hit by a spectre inflicts 1d8 points of damage in addition to a double energy drain (the victim loses two experience levels). A character slain by a spectre will rise the next night as a spectre under the control of the slayer.

**Terrain:** Ruins.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).

A sphinx is a large, winged creature with a lion's body and a human's face. It is fond of dry climates, but may be encountered anywhere, most often as a guard. Some Chaotic sphinxes are very territorial, settling on a hilltop near a road and preventing all travelers from passing along that road.

Both male and female sphinxes are very intelligent spellcasters, the female a 12th level cleric and the male a 12 level magic-user. Their magic is so powerful that all saving throws against their spells are made with a —4 penalty.

In combat, a sphinx can attack with claws and bite (or spells), but its most feared attack is its roar. The roar is usable only twice per day, but is quite powerful. Each victim within 120' must make a saving throw vs. spells at a —4 penalty or flee in *fear* for 1d6 turns. Each victim within 60' must check for *fear* (as above) and must also make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be stunned for 1-6 rounds. (See the "Special Character Conditions" section of Chapter 13 for more on the effects of stunning.) Each victim within 10' must check for *fear* and *stun* (as above), but also takes 6d6 points of damage, and is deafened for 1d10 turns (no saving throw).

The sphinx is immune to all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level spells and to nonmagical weapons. It loves puzzles, riddles, and trivia. Characters may avoid combat or gain the sphinx's friendship by solving the sphinx's riddles.

If two sphinxes are encountered together, they are a mated pair; if more than two are encountered, they are a mated pair with cubs.

**Terrain:** Any; especially Desert.

**Load:** 6,000 cn at full speed; 12,000 cn at half speed.

### Monster Type: Lowlife (Rare).

Giant spiders are simply huge versions of normal spider species. All giant spiders can be dangerous, and many are poisonous. All are carnivores, either trapping their prey in webs or jumping at victims by surprise. However, they are rarely intelligent, and will often flee from fire. Three examples of giant spiders are given here.

Crab Spider: This is a 5' long spider with a chameleonlike ability to blend into its surroundings, surprising on a roll of 1-4 (on 1d6). It clings to walls or ceilings and drops onto its prey. After the first attack, it can be seen and attacked normally. Any victim of its bite must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in 1d4 turns. However, the poison is weak, and the victim gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw roll.

Black Widow Spider: This vicious arachnid is 6' long, and has a red "hourglass" mark on its belly. It usually stays close to its webbed lair. The webs should be treated as the magic-user's web spell for the chances of breaking free, once en-

trapped. The webs may also be burned away. Any victim of the bite of a black widow spider must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in 1 turn.

Tarantella: A tarantella is a huge hairy magical spider that looks like a 7' long tarantula. Its bite does not kill; instead, it causes the victim (if a saving throw vs. poison is failed) to have painful spasms that resemble a frantic dance. This dance has a magical effect on onlookers. Anyone watching the dance must make a saving throw vs. spells or start to dance in the same way. Dancing victims have a penalty of -4 on their attack rolls, and attackers gain +4 on their attack rolls. The effects of the bite last for 2d6 turns. However, dancers will drop from exhaustion in 5 turns, and they will then be helpless against attacks. Those caught while watching will dance as long as the original victim. (A *dispel magic* spell will stop the dance.)

Terrain: Crab: Cavern, Ruins. Black Widow, Tarantella: Ruins. Woods.

### Monster Type: Planar Monster (Very Rare).

The "planar spiders" are intelligent plane-traveling arachnids with a vast, but odd, civilization. They can travel through planes and dimensions at will. Those most commonly encountered have 5 Hit Dice, but leaders of up to 12 Hit Dice have been found. Their home plane is not known, and no traces of cities have ever been discovered; planar spiders describe it as a world covered with cities made up of buildings lovingly crafted from imperishable white webs. Planar spiders are widely-enough traveled that most speak Common.

In combat, a planar spider arrives from another plane (usually the Ethereal), attacks, and then "shifts" back to the other plane. It automatically gains initiative when "shifting," and usually (75%) cannot be attacked before it leaves! However, *hasted* opponents may attack normally before the creature "shifts."

Normally, any victim bitten must make a saving throw vs. poison with a -4 penalty to the roll, or die. However, the creature can choose to bite without using the poison, if desired.

Any spider encountered may have 1d4 miscellaneous magical items that it can use, or it may have 1d4 odd but nonmagical items with which it—but not humans—is familiar.

Occasional rare encounters may be with spellcasting planar spider clerics or magic-users (maximum 9th level in either). For XP calculations, one asterisk is added for each two levels of spell use. Planar spiders that cast spells cannot cast spells and then phase out in the same round.

Planar spiders will not automatically attack PCs. In fact, since they're the primary intelligence of their own planes, they should be played much like humans. There could be planar-spider bandits, NPC adventuring parties, etc. Most, when encountered, will speak to PCs and find out their intentions toward him: This could be a real surprise to characters who have only encountered "normal" giant spiders!

Terrain: Any.

DM Checklist:Attacks: Poison touch and presence; cleric spells; other specials

Defenses: +2 weapon or better to hit; immune to 1st-3rd level spells

Druj only: First successful turn attempt forces druj components to reunite; subsequent turn rolls handled normally.

*Monster Type:* Undead, Enchanted (Very Rare).

Spirits are powerful evil beings inhabiting the bodies (or body parts) of others; they are among the nastiest of undead monsters. They are immune to spells below 4th level, and cannot be harmed by normal weapons or magical weapons of less than +2 enchantment.

All spirits are travelers, never staying in one place for more than one night; they become invisible and nearly powerless (except to move) with the light of dawn, regaining their powers at dusk. In daylight, any spirit can travel up to 24 miles per day (1 hex).

All spirits are poisonous. When hit by a spirit in hand-to-hand combat, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die immediately. A new saving throw must be made for each hit by the spirit.

The poisonous presence of a spirit causes all consumable items within 30', including normal food and water, holy water, all rations (even iron) and even magical potions to become spoiled and useless (but not poisoned), with no saving throw allowed. Even living plants and small insects within this area are paralyzed, dying if the spirit remains there more than an hour. This effect negates all forms of plant control, insect swarms and plagues, both normal and magical.

All spirits can sense invisible things, and can attack them without penalty. All spirits can, once per round, at will, create the following cleric spell effects: *darkness*, *silence* 15' radius, *cause disease*, *animate dead*, *finger of death* (all as if cast by a 16th level cleric). A spirit will often pause to *animate* the body of a fallen victim, creating and controlling it as a zombie to fight for it and add to the chaos. (Attempts at turning such zombies are made as if turning the spirit itself!) All of these spell-like abilities require concentration, as do normal spells, so while using an ability, a spirit cannot attack physically. Unlike normal cleric spells, no words or gestures are needed.

A spirit normally has no treasure, though it may occasionally serve as a guard for some special item. Those characters who risk travel at night may encounter a spirit with 1d6 of its victims, who may carry treasure.

**Druj:** Druj appear as body parts, floating or crawling about in a horrible way. A druj is usually encountered in the form of a hand, eye, or skull. Druj are very intelligent and strongly evil, far more dangerous than they may seem.

A druj can split its essence, creating four (identical) forms instead of one. This can be performed only once per night. Each of the forms can attack separately, but only one of the forms is able to cast spells (as given above). The form using the spells can often be distinguished, as it will hover nearby while the other forms attack. If that form is slain, one of the surviving forms immediately gains all unused spellcasting abilities. All four forms are poisonous.

If turned by a cleric, the parts of a druj turned are forced to reunite into one creature, remaining united for 1d4 + 1 rounds. Further success at turning is handled normally.

Druj are always encountered singly unless commanded into service by a lich or more powerful member of the Sphere of Death. In such cases, two druj eyes may rest within a druj skull, accompanied by two druj hands; no more than these five druj can ever gather in one place.

**Eye:** An eye druj darts about, trying to touch (poison) its opponent; a touch does not inflict any damage other than poisoning. Each eye druj can also gaze at one victim per round (30' range), in addition to its physical attack. The victim must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be paralyzed for 1d4 turns. The eye druj may touch a paralyzed victim automatically.

**Hand:** A hand druj inflicts 1d4 points of damage when it hits, and thereafter holds onto its victim, causing automatic damage each round thereafter. The damage caused is equal to the AC of the victim, ignoring dexterity and shield bonuses, plus 1d4 points. If the adjusted armor class is a negative number, the attack will still inflict 1d4 points of damage each round.

**Skull:** A skull druj floats toward and bites its victim. When first approached, the victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or be frozen with fear, allowing the skull druj to bite (no attack roll needed) for 2d4 points of damage. The normal saving throw vs. poison applies to each bite.

**Odic:** This evil spirit travels up to 24 miles each day, settling into a plant by night. It is dangerous even if avoided, as it animates parts of the plant to do its bidding. The plant can easily be seen at long range (up to 300 yards), as the odic radiates a purplish light in a 20' radius. Any living being within this light must make a saving throw vs. spells or lose 1 level because of energy drain (as if struck by a wight).

| 7,525                          |  |

Once it has settled for the night, an odic cannot move from the spot until daybreak. While using its spells, it can attack by animating part of the plant. The longest branch or vine of the plant reaches out (10-30' range), attacking as a 16 HD monster and inflicting 1d12 points of damage per hit (in addition to poison).

The plant is immediately killed when the odic possesses it. The creature uses the plant's parts to seek out other life to feed on. Most commonly, it animates individual leaves, which float away (movement rate 30' per round) in search of victims; it can animate up to 6 such leaves at one time. The leaves may be sent up to 1 mile from die odic. Animated leaves normally gain surprise (90% chance). Each leaf attacks as if a 4 Hit Dice monster; no damage is inflicted, but each victim hit must make a saving throw vs. spells or be *charmed*. A *charmed* victim is drawn toward the odic, and has a 4 penalty on the saving throw against the energy drain when entering the purple aura.

If the plant possessed has no detachable leaves, the odic may animate other portions (pine needles, flowers, etc.) in a similar manner, as described above—up to 6 at once, each with a *charm* ability per touch.

Odics occasionally inhabit the bodies of plantlike monsters. The creature may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the possession, but may die from the level draining and other abilities of the odic even if the saving throw is successful. The odic gains the abilities of any plantlike monster possessed. They may be used in addition to the normal abilities of the odic.

Odics are always encountered singly.

**Revenant:** This horror appears to be a zombie, though it walks at a faster rate. It never carries weapons. The revenant roams the night in search of victims, surprising them 50% of the time. It can leap once per turn to a 60' range; when both surprising and leaping on a victim, its three attacks all hit (no attack rolls needed), causing normal damage and three separate saving throws vs. poison.

Once per night, a revenant can *summon* 1d4 spectres to come to its aid. The spectres will arrive 1d6 + 2 rounds after being summoned, and will obey and fight for the revenant. They may be turned as normal spectres.

Revenants are resistant to turning attempts. If any "D" result is indicated, the revenant may make a saving throw vs. spells; if successful, the attempt has no effect. A "turn" result gives no saving throw, but the revenant will return in 1d4 turns.

Revenants are always encountered singly.

**Terrain:** Any (usually) Barren Lands and Ruins).

*Monster Type:* Monster (Very Rare).

The sporacle appears identical to a beholder at first glance: a floating ball-like creature, 5' in diameter, with a huge gaping mouth and a large central eye above it. Tentacles sprout from its entire body. It has six eyes, positioned evenly about the surface of the body (top, bottom, front, back, sides). It normally keeps all but a few upper tentacles retracted.

A sporacle regenerates by submerging itself in fresh water (but not in brine) at the rate of 3 hit points per round so lost body parts may be rapidly regrown. If a loose tentacle falls or is placed in water, it will grow into a whole creature in 1 hour. This is their only method of reproduction, so they are often found near a water source.

A sporacle may attack anything, but prefers humanoids as food. As it moves into combat, it extends all its tentacles, appearing to sprout them as it attacks. It moves through air or water by magical flight, but is very quick. It spins rapidly in all directions when in combat, using all of its tentacles each round against 1 or 2 opponents. A sporacle has average intelligence (10) and cannot use spells or magical items.

The sporacle prefers not to bite victims that are still moving. It uses its tentacle attacks only, until all have been destroyed; only then will it resort to its ferocious bite. Each tentacle hit inflicts 1 point of damage, and each requires a saving throw vs. paralysis. Failure indicates that the venomous tentacle has struck skin, and takes effect. This paralysis is a delayed sort, however, taking effect after 1 round passes; it lasts for 1 turn thereafter unless cured. If its opponents flee, it will remain to feast upon its paralyzed victims; if there are none, it always pursues.

The sporacle may be damaged by any sort of edged weapon, and by any missile weapon except a sling. However, it is immune to blunt weapons, and to all spells and magical devices except those that cause damage; these will destroy one tentacle per die of damage (or per *magic missile*), not affecting the creature's hit points. Once all the tentacles are destroyed, such spells have no further effect. Sporacles cannot hear, and are immune to all sound-based effects; they are also immune to poison, paralysis, and *charms*.

If any attacker declares the tentacles to be the target of the blow, and uses an edged weapon, the tentacle is AC 4, and easily severed. After falling off, a tentacle will live for up to 1 hour, remaining venomous for that time. When the creature is reduced to 0 hit points or less, its body comes apart grotesquely, spinning wildly and sending all remaining tentacles in various directions. (Make final attack rolls as applicable.)

*Terrain:* Cavern.

*Monster Type:* Construct, Enchanted (Common).

A living statue is an enchanted animated creature made by a powerful wizard. It appears to be a perfectly normal statue—until it moves! A living statue may be any size or material; the sizes given are typical. Living crystal, iron, and rock statues are given as examples, and the DM may create others. (Not every statue in a campaign should be a living statue. If every statue in your campaign is a living statue, PCs will know that any statue they see can attack them. Have noblemen possess statuary as treasure and decoration; have expensive public buildings and plazas be decorated with statues; living statues are very rare in comparison with the numbers of "real" statues.)

Living statues are not affected by *sleep* spells. Crystal: A living crystal statue is a life form made of crystals instead of flesh. Crystal statues can look like statues of anything, but often appear human.

Sprites are small winged people (about 1 foot tall) related to pixies and elves. Though shy, they are very curious and have a strange sense of humor.

Five sprites acting together can cast one curse spell. This will take the form of a magic practical joke, such as tripping or having one's nose grow. The exact effect of the curse is left to the DM's imagination. (The effects of the sprites' curse can be countered by a *remove curse* spell.) Sprites will never cause death on purpose even if they are attacked.

There can be sprite spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

*Terrain:* Woods.

Iron: A living iron statue has a body that can absorb iron and steel. It takes normal damage when hit, but if a nonmagical metal weapon is used, the attacker must make a saving throw vs. spells or the weapon will become stuck in the body of the living iron statue, and can only be removed if the statue is killed. (If the weapon is left in the statue, the statue will eventually absorb the metal completely and eject nonmetal parts, so the statue will not forever walk around with weapons sticking out of it.)

Rock: A living rock statue has an outer crust of stone but is filled with hot magma (fiery lava). When the creature attacks, it squirts the magma from its fingertips (or similar members) for 2d6 points of damage per hit.

*Terrain:* Any (especially Ruins).

*Load:* Crystal Statue: 1,500 cn at full speed; 3,000 cn at half speed. Iron Statue: 2,000 cn at full speed; 4,000 cn at half speed. Rock Statue: 2,500 cn at full speed; 5,000 cn at half speed.

*Monster Type:* Monster (Common).

A stirge is a birdlike creature with a long nose. It attacks by thrusting its beak into the victim's body, and feeds on blood. A successful hit (for 1d3 points of damage) means that it has attached itself to the victim, sucking for 1d3 points of damage per round until the victim is dead.

A flying stirge gains a bonus of +2 on its first attack roll against any one opponent due to its speedy diving attack.

*Monster Type:* Lowlife (Common).

Water termites range from 1'-5" long, the largest found only in ocean waters. All are shaped like normal termites, except for an elastic sac in their abdomen that can intake and expel water for movement and feeding. When the sac is completely expanded, the creature looks like a large balloon with a small insectlike head on the front.

The creature does not bite unless cornered; instead, it uses an inky spray for defense. When frightened above water, a normal attack roll

must be made. A victim hit by the spray must make a saving throw vs. poison or be paralyzed for 1 turn. If the creature is frightened underwater, its ink does not paralyze, but merely provides an inky cover for the creature's retreat.

The real terror of these creatures is the destruction they bring to ships. They cling to hulls, each causing points of hull damage equal to their bite before letting go. Once any damage has been inflicted, there is a 50% chance per round that someone will notice the leakage.

*Terrain:* Swamp, Lake, Ocean.

A thoul is a magical combination of a ghoul, a hobgoblin, and a troll. Except when very close, thouls look exactly like hobgoblins, and are sometimes found as part of the bodyguard of a hobgoblin king or Chaotic ruler.

The touch of a thoul will paralyze (in the same way as that of a ghoul). If it is damaged, a thoul will regenerate 1 hit point per round as long as it is alive.

*Monster Type:* Giant Animal (Common).

**Giant Toad:** A giant toad is about the size of a very large dog, and weighs 150-250 pounds. It can change its skin color to blend into woods or poorly lit dungeons, surprising its prey on a roll of 1-3 (on 1d6). It can shoot its tongue out to 15', and may drag victims of dwarf size or smaller to its mouth to be bitten. Small prey is swallowed whole on a attack roll of 20, causing 1d6 points of damage each round thereafter.

**Rock Toad/Cave Toad:** A rock toad, or "cave toad", lives in rocky, cold regions such as high mountains or frozen deserts. It is about the size of a large dog, weighs 150 pounds, and carries a hard, bumpy shell on its back (like a turtle). On its head, it has bulging, multi-faceted eyes similar to a fly's. The eyes shine with a hypnotic glow. Any creature gazing into the eyes must save vs. paralysis, or be paralyzed for 2-8 (2d4) rounds. The eyes will continue to cast a feeble 'light (5' radius) for 1d3 hours after the creature dies, but the hypnotic powers will be lost. When attacking, it bites with a horny, beaked mouth.

*Terrain:* Giant Toad: Cavern; Woods (near water). Rock/Cave Toad: Cavern; Desert (cold). Mountain.

| Alignment:     | Lawful     |
| XP Value:      | 1,200      |

*Monster Type:* Monster (Rare).

A treant is an 18' tall, intelligent creature that looks like a tree with facial features. It has two main branches that act as arms with hands, and it walks upon legs that end in rootlike feet.

It is concerned only with the protection of forests and plant life; it is friends with most of the intelligent forest creatures (actaeons, centaurs, dryads, etc.). Treants speak a slow and difficult tongue, and distrust those who use fire.

All encounters with treants begin at a distance of 30 yards or less, since they are nearly identical to normal trees, and they surprise on a roll of 1-3 (on 1d6). Although normal weapons can harm them, blunt weapons (such as maces) only inflict 1 point of damage per hit (plus magic and strength bonuses).

Each treant can animate any two trees within 60' to move at 30' (10') and fight as treants. A treant may change which trees it is animating from round to round.

There can be treant spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

*Monster Type:* Prehistoric Animal (Very Rare).

This is an armored herbivorous dinosaur. It walks about on four legs and has much the same temperament as an elephant. The triceratops is about 30' long and weighs 10-12 tons. A collarlike armor plate grows from its head to protect its neck, and its weapons include a short horn growing from its snout and two long horns growing above its eyes. A single triceratops is a match for all but the largest of the predatory carnivores.

Although it is an herbivore, it is aggressive and dangerous, usually attacking on sight. It might *charge* (for double damage) on the first attack, and on any attack after it has gotten 20 yards or more away from its enemy.

*Terrain:* Open (prehistoric).

**Monster Type:** Humanoid (Rare).

A troglodyte is an intelligent humanoid reptile. It has a short tail, long legs, and a spiny "comb" on its head and arms. Troglodytes walk upright and use their hands as well as humans. They hate most other creatures.

Troglodytes have the chameleonlike ability to change colors, and use it to hide by rock walls, surprising often (1-4 on 1d6). A troglodyte also secretes an oil that produces a stench, nauseating humans and demihumans unless a saving throw vs. poison is made. Nauseated characters have a -2 penalty on their attack rolls while in hand-to-hand combat with the troglodytes.

There can be troglodyte spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

**Monster Type:** Giant Humanoid (Rare).

Trolls are 8'-tall, thin, somewhat intelligent humanoids, with ferocious features, sharp teeth, and a mottled skin almost like rubber.

They are carnivores, and prefer human and humanlike victims to all other foods. They live nearly anywhere, often in the ruined dwellings of their victims.

A troll is very strong, and rens its opponents with talons and sharp teeth. It has the power of regeneration, the ability to grow back together when damaged. It begins to regenerate 3 rounds after it is damaged. The troll's wounds heal themselves at a rate of 3 hit points per round, and even severed limbs will crawl back to the body and rejoin. The head and claws of the troll will continue to fight as long as the creature has 1 hit point or more. However, the troll cannot regenerate damage from fire or acid, and when attacked by these methods, the morale score is 8. Unless totally destroyed by fire or acid, it will eventually regenerate completely.

There can be troll Spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

**Monster Type:** Prehistoric Animal (Very Rare).

The "tyrant lizard" is the largest hunting dinosaur found. It's at least 40' long (and can be longer), weighing in at 8 tons; when standing, it is about 20' high. It inhabits "lost world" areas.

The tyrannosaurus walks on its hind legs, with its heavy tail held out behind as a counterbalance. Its forelimbs are small, bearing two claws each, but are next to useless in combat. However, its mighty jaws, bearing teeth up to 6" long, more than make up for that deficit. It will attack anything man-sized or larger, usually attacking the largest creature first. It can swallow a man-sized opponent if its attack roll is 19-20; the victim takes 2d4 points of damage each round until removed.

**Terrain:** Jungle, Open, Woods (prehistoric).

| XP Value:      | 2,300            |

**Monster Type:** Planar Monster, Enchanted (Very Rare).

An undine is an intelligent creature made of water. It is rare even on the elemental plane of Water, its home, and is almost never encountered on the Prime Plane. Undines are Chaotic in behavior, but (similar to djinn) have very good intentions and despise evil.

On its home plane, an undine normally has a form like a featureless transparent snake. It can easily change shape, sometimes using a form with many tentacles to handle objects. Once per turn, it can swim quickly in the form of a revolving coil, moving at 480' (160') rate for up to 10 rounds.

Undines are immune to poison, normal weapons, all 1st and 2nd level spells, and to all attacks based on fire. An undine can *detect invisible* at will, and can use *detect magic*, *web*, *dispel magic*, *ice storm* / *wall*, and *fire to ice* three times per day (all as if a 9th level magic-user). An undine's *web* is made of ice strands, which function in the same way; however, flame merely melts the *web*, rather than burning it, and trapped victims take

![Illustration of a Tyrannosaurus Rex roaring, showing sharp teeth and a large head.]()![](_page_209_Picture_28.jpeg)

no damage from the melting.

An undine can attack with one "fist" (armlike extension) per round. If the blow hits, the undine may choose to coil around the opponent, squeezing for 1d10 points of automatic constriction damage each round. An undine can coil around any creature of giant size or less, and the victim cannot move, attack, or concentrate.

On the Prime Plane, an undine appears identical to a water elemental. While in water, it is invisible, and regenerates damage at the rate of 3 points per round. When out of water, however, it does not regenerate, and instead takes 1 point of damage per round from drying. An undine is not as limited as an elemental; it is not blocked by a protection from evil effect, and is not forced to remain within 60' of water.

Their enemies are the hydrax and the hordes, and they fear air-type creatures and attacks.

**Terrain:** Plane of Water.

**Monster Type:** Monster (Rare).A unicorn looks like a slender horse with a horn growing from its forehead. Unicorns are always very beautiful animals; no one has ever seen an ugly one. Unicorns are shy creatures, but fierce when cornered. Only a pure maiden can talk to or ride one. A unicorn can magically teleport itself (with a rider) to a distance of 360' once per day. A unicorn's morale is improved (9) if it has a rider.

These creatures live in the deep forests, far away from sentient creatures. They are often hunted by evil wizards, who prize their horns for their alchemical potions and spell researches.

**Monster Type:** Undead, Enchanted (Rare).Vampires are among the most feared of the undead. They haunt ruins, tombs, crypts and other places deserted by man, but fly out at night to prey on man.

**Abilities of Vampires:** Vampires are unaffected by *sleep*, *charm*, and *hold* spells, and can only be hit with magical weapons. A vampire may take the form of a human, a dire wolf, a giant bat, or a gaseous cloud at will. Each change takes 1 round.

Whatever its form, a vampire regenerates 3 hit points per round, starting as soon as it is damaged. If a vampire is reduced to 0 hit points it does not regenerate, but becomes gaseous and flees to its coffin.

In dire wolf or giant bat form, the vampire's move, attacks, and damage are those of the animal. The vampire's AC, Hit Dice, morale, and saving throws remain unchanged. In gaseous form, a vampire cannot attack, but can fly at the speed given

above and is immune to all weapon attacks.

In human form, a vampire can attack by gaze or touch, or can summon other creatures. The touch of a vampire inflicts a double energy drain (removing 2 levels of experience) in addition to damage. The creature's gaze can *charm*. Any victim who meets the gaze may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the *charm*, but with a -2 penalty to the roll.

The vampire may summon any one of the following creatures, which will come to its aid if they are within 300 feet (300 yards outdoors):

| Rats   | 10-100 | Giant rats  | 5-20 |
|--------|--------|-------------|------|
| Bats   | 10-100 | Giant bats  | 3-18 |
| Wolves | 3-18   | Diré wolves | 2-8  |

Any character slain by a vampire will return from death in three days, as a vampire under the control of the slayer.

There can be vampire spellcasters; see "Monster Spellcasters" later in this chapter.

**Weaknesses of Vampires:** A vampire cannot come within 10 feet of a strongly presented holy symbol, although it can move to attack from another direction. The odor of garlic repels a vampire; the creature must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or stay at least 10 feet away from the garlic during that round.

Vampires cannot cross running water, either on foot or flying, except at bridges or while in their coffins. During the day, a vampire usually rests in its coffin; failure to do so results in the loss of 2d6 hit points per day. These hit points are not regenerated until the vampire has rested in its coffin for a full day. A vampire casts no reflection and avoids mirrors.

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_211_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 14: Monsters

A vampire may be destroyed by driving a wooden stake through its heart or by immersion in running water for 1 turn. If a vampire is exposed to direct sunlight, the creature must make a saving throw vs. death ray each round or disintegrate. A *continual* light spell will not disintegrate a vampire. If all of the vampire's coffins are blessed or destroyed, the vampire will weaken, taking 2d6 hit points of damage per day. It dies when its hit points are reduced to 0.

A giant weasel is 8'-9" long and covered with a richly colored fur of white, gold, or brown. These quick and vicious predators hunt singly or in groups. Once they bite, they will hold on and suck blood, doing 2d4 points of damage each round until their prey is dead or until they are killed.

Giant weasels have infravision to 30' and can track parties by scent. They will pursue wounded prey in preference to all other. They live in tunnels underground.

*Monster Type:* Undead, Enchanted (Common).

A wight is an undead spirit living in the body of a dead human or demihuman. A wight looks much as its body appeared in life, but bone-white and thin, with hollow, lifeless eyes. Its burial garments will be tattered and filthy.

Wights can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are greatly feared, as they drain life energy when striking a victim. Each hit drains one level of experience or Hit Die. Any person totally drained of life energy by a wight will become a wight in 1d4 days, and will be under control of the slayer.

*Terrain:* Barren Lands, Ruins.

Killer Whale: These are 25' long and are found mainly in cold waters. They live by hunting other sea creatures. Creatures of halfing size or smaller will be swallowed whole if the killer whale scores a 20 on its hit roll. Those swallowed take 1d6 points of damage per round and will drown in 10 rounds unless freed.

*Great Whale:* This huge whale is about 60' long on the average. It preys on the most feared denizens of the deep (such as the giant octopus and giant squid). Man-sized or smaller creatures will be swallowed whole on a die roll that is 4 or more than the score needed to hit. A swallowed creature will take 3d6 points of acid damage per round. Great whales will sometimes (10%) attack ships, attempting to ram. The monster whale does 6d6 hull points of damage in a successful ram.

Extremely rare great whales might grow to double or triple this size, with a corresponding increase in Hit Dice and damage. There are rumors of monster whales large enough to swallow an entire harbor of ships!

Narwhal: The narwhal is 15' long, gray to white in color, and has an 8' long spiral horn on its head (like that of a unicorn). It is an intelligent magical creature, very independent and secretive. It is rumored that their horns vibrate in the presence of evil. Their horns are worth from 1,000 to 6,000 gold pieces each for their ivory.

*Terrain:* Ocean.

Diré Wolves: Diré wolves are larger and more ferocious than normal wolves, and are semi-intelligent. They are fierce enemies and usually hunt in packs. They are found in caves, woods, or mountains. They are sometimes trained by goblins to be used as mounts. Captured diré wolf cubs can be trained like dogs (if the DM permits), but they are even more savage than normal wolves.

cal body, appearing as a pale, almost transparent, manlike figure of thick mist. A wraith is a spirit of the unhappy dead, selfishly holding itself to the Prime Plane by draining life from the living. Wraiths dwell in deserted lands or in the dwellings of creatures they have slain or driven away.

Wraiths are immune to *sleep*, *charm*, and *hold spells*. A wraith can only be hit by silver or magical weapons, but silver weapons will only do half damage. The touch of a wraith is an energy drain of 1 level, in addition to causing 1d6 points of damage. A victim slain by a wraith will become a wraith in one day, under the control of the slayer.

**Monster Type:** Monster, Dragon-Kin (Rare).

A wyvern looks like a two-legged dragon with a long tail. Unlike dragons, wyverns are mostly brown, red, or rust-red in hue. These beasts prefer to live on cliffs or in forests, but may be found anywhere.

In combat, the wyvern will bite and arch its tail over its head to hit opponents in front of it. Those stung by the tail must make a saving throw vs. poison or die.

Like most dragon-kin, wyverns are carnivores. They prefer the taste of large herd-beasts such as elk and moose, but will attack humans they encounter and eat the remains if they are victorious.

**Terrain:** Mountain, Woods.

**Monster Type:** Lowlife (Common).

This deadly fungus covers an area of 100 square feet ( $10' \times 10'$  area counts as one monster, and many may be found together). Yellow mold can only be killed by fire: a torch will do  $1d4$  points of damage to it each round. It can eat through wood and leather but cannot harm metal or stone. It does not actually attack, but if it is touched, even by a torch, the touch may ( $50\% \text{ chance per touch}$ ) cause the mold to squirt out a  $10' \times 10' \times 10'$  cloud of spores. Anyone caught within the cloud will take  $1d6$  points of damage and must make a saving throw vs. death ray or choke to death within 6 rounds.

**Monster Type:** Undead, Enchanted (Common).

Zombies are mindless undead humans or demihumans. They are empty corpses animated by an evil magic-user or cleric. They are often used as cheap labor and cheap soldiers by evil rulers. They can be turned by clerics but are not affected by *sleep* or *charm* spells. They can be harmed by normal weapons. Zombies are often placed to guard treasures, since they make no noise. They are slow fighters, and always lose initiative (no roll needed).

**Terrain:** Ruins.

# Chapter 14: Monsters

## Changing Monsters

The given monster descriptions are guidelines. The DM can change details of any individual monster to suit the needs of the campaign or of a specific adventure. Unexpected changes add new levels of excitement and mystery.

## Basic Ways to Vary Monsters

### 1. Change the Physical Description.

- Arctic snakes that have white fur but are otherwise identical to rock pythons.
- Oxen cross-bred with gorgons, resembling the former, but with the statistics and breath weapon of the latter.
- A tribe of small cannibals: short and wizened bald men with bushy eyebrows, red tattoos of serpents on their arms, and filed teeth (kobold statistics).

### 2. Add Special Abilities.

- Skeletons that hurl their finger joints as *magic missiles*.
- A larger than average basilisk, such that saves versus its petrification are at -2.
- A halfing village whose militia is +2 with slings instead of +1.
- Winged elves with a flying move of 150' (50').

### 3. Take Details From Nature.

- Spiders that throw nets of web (up to 120') to snare their prey.
- Snakes, such as the poisonous coral snake and the harmless king snake, told apart by the order of their colored banding.
- Flying squirrels (possibly carnivorous or rabid) that glide to attack intruders.
- Creatures using natural behavioral patterns: such as hunting packs that drive the prey into ambush set by other pack members; or animals that threaten and retreat instead of mindlessly attacking.

### 4. Use Unusual Tactics or Weapons.

- A giant "bags" characters with a giant sack instead of using a weapon.
- An ogre uses an unusual club (the only oar of a boat the party finds later).
- Kobolds use flasks of flaming oil and pit traps that open when someone heavier than 50 pounds steps on them.
- Arctic cavern men pelt the party with bladders of seal blood, which attracts ravenous polar bears.
- Hoggoblins set spears against party charges, while their archers fire overhead.
- A wizard owns a pair of *charmed* and *hasted* hydras.

### 5. Create NPCs With Special Attack Forms.

- The King's Executioner, who has a +2 attack bonus with his axe, and chops off a man-sized opponent's head on a natural roll of 20.
- An ore cook carrying a pan of grease, who will throw it in front of the party before he runs away (PCs slip, slide, and

possibly fall if they pursue).

- A Lawful archer, who can shoot a weapon out of someone's hand, sever a rope, or make any other type of nondamaging shot with his normal attack roll.

### 6. Reverse Party Expectations.

- An ochre jelly hiding up a chimney; soot covered, it looks like a black pudding.
- A gnoll leader that, when it sees the party, snarls: "It's about time you got here. Fall in and follow me . . ."
- A room with giant spiders that has reversed gravity (the spiders look right-side up, but are actually on the room's ceiling).

### 7. Create Campaign-Based Cultural Details.

- A local encounter table that changes the frequency of monsters, including (or excluding) certain creatures. Special NPCs can be added to such tables.
- A hidden sect of druids who are Chaotic and evil due to an ancient curse.
- Orcs with different tribal traits:
  1. Orcs of the Red Hand seldom run in combat (+2 morale bonus).
  2. Orcs of the Crooked Tooth are cowardly and won't attack unless they have at least 2-to-1 odds. They are especially treacherous and untrustworthy, even for orcs.
  3. Orcs of the Yellow Eye are assassins who prefer garrotes and blowguns. They are seldom seen; many have clerical spells. Each has a small dagger tattooed somewhere on its body.
  4. Orcs of the White Mountain use black-fletched arrows. They *always* keep their word once they give it, and suffer no penalty in bright light.

### 8. Make Special Combination Monsters.

- Pixie archers riding giant bees.
- A troll lord with a *ring of acid resistance*, and *horn of blasting*, riding a giant slug.
- A medusa with twice normal hit dice, armed with a *magic bow* and poisoned *arrows* +2, and immune to the effects of her reflected gaze.
- A symbiotic black pudding shaped like a black dragon, that spits green slime.
- An obsidian golem that shatters when slain, revealing a bronze golem inside. This belches out small (2-3 Hit Die) fire elemental each round until slain.

The most important thing to remember about changing monsters is that the party will be set up by their familiarity with the existing monsters. Have fun!

Sometimes a more detailed approach to changing monsters is useful. The following optional rules can be used if desired.

### Monster Intelligence

The Intelligence of a creature is a valuable guide to role-playing an encounter. Stupid creatures may make tactical errors in combat; smart ones may surprise characters with brilliant traps,

verbal assaults, and fast reactions to unexpected situations. Intelligence is also needed to find the results of a *charm* or *maze* spell.

In the Monster List, average Intelligence scores are given for each monster race. But individuals may have higher or lower Intelligences. Spellcasters always have higher-than-average Intelligence, for instance; leaders often do.

To determine the Intelligence of an individual, find the average Intelligence of its race from the monster description. Go to the line corresponding to that score on the Monster Intelligence table. Roll two six-sided dice (2d6). The first die is used to determine how much this individual's Intelligence varies from the race's average; move across to the column corresponding to the number you rolled. The second die is used to determine whether to subtract (1-3) or add (4-6) this amount from the race's average. Treat results of less than 0 as 0 and results of greater than 18 as 18. Vampires and lowlifes ignore subtractions.

#### Monster Intelligence Table

| Race's<br>Average<br>Intelligence | Maximum |   |   |   |   |   | Die Roll (1d6) |
|-----------------------------------|---------|---|---|---|---|---|----------------|
|                                   | —       |   |   |   |   |   |                |
|                                   |         |   |   |   |   |   |                |
| 0-1                               | 1       | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1              |
| 2-3                               | 1       | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1              |
| 4-5                               | 2       | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2              |
| 6-8                               | 3       | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3              |
| 9-12                              | 4       | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4              |
| 13-15                             | 4       | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4              |
| 16-17                             | 3       | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3              |
| 18                                | 2       | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2              |

**Example:** The merman has a listed Intelligence of 12. To determine the score of an individual merman, a DM goes to the "9-12" line on the table above. He rolls 1d6 and the result is a 4; therefore, the variation will be a 2. He rolls another 1d6 and the result is a 6; therefore, the variation will be added to the Intelligence score. This merman's actual Intelligence is 14.

### Size

The Hit Dice given for a type of creature should be taken as the average for the species. Both smaller and larger versions often exist. To change the size of a monster, decide whether you want this specific monster to be smaller or larger than average. Then, use the following modifiers:

#### If smaller:

- -3 Much smaller than normal
- -2 Smaller than normal
- -1 Slightly smaller than normal

#### If larger:

- +1 Slightly larger than normal
- +2 Larger than normal (2-3 x size)
- +3 Much larger than normal (4 + X size)

Choose whichever modifier you think is most appropriate for this type of monster. For example, an ogre that is Much Larger Than Normal would take the +3 modifier.

These modifiers are similar to ability modifiers for characters. They are used in the following manner:

| Hit points:                                            | Add the modifier as points per Hit Die.* |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Attack rolls:                                          | Add the modifier to the roll.            |
| Damage:                                                | Add the modifier per die of damage.*     |
| Saves:                                                 | Subtract the modifier from the roll.     |
| Armor:                                                 | Subtract the modifier from the AC.       |
| * There should always be a minimum of 1 point per die. |                                          |

To calculate the XP value of different size monsters, take the total number of bonus hit points and divide by 5, rounding up fractions; add the result to the base HD total of the monster. This is the number of Hit Dice to be used when calculating XP value.

For example, a normal-sized gorgon would have:

AC 2; HD 8\*; THACO 12; Dmg 2d6; Save F8

The largest variety of common gorgon would have:

AC -1; HD 8 + 24\*; THACO 9; Dmg 2d6 + 6; Save F8 + 3; XP Value: As 13 HD

**Tribal Leaders:** Some creatures that live in tribes have hereditary leaders who gain the title by birth. The larger size of these leaders can be reinforced through the generations; most will have modifiers of +3 based on the guidelines above.

**Turning Undead:** An unusually large or small undead might be turned by a cleric with the same chances as the normal form, or possibly as a more or less powerful undead (corresponding to the new Hit Dice).

## Age

Consider the average number of hit points per Hit Die as a reflection of a monster's age. A newborn creature would have 1 hit point per Hit Die (the minimum) and gradually gains more hit points as it ages. The average score (4 1/2 points per die on the average) is reached at the prime of life: a mature, well-developed creature just approaching middle age for its race. After that point, hit points usually decline, reaching as few as twice the minimum (newborn) hit points. Deafated monsters should only be worth their full, listed XP value when at full health; you can reduce the XP value when a monster is too young or too old to have full hit points.

Monster size also often varies by age, beginning at 10-25% of adult size and shrinking to 90% of adult size in old age.

## Environmental Variations

Monsters may easily be adapted to different environments. Under water, for example, players would expect the usual predators—fish, shark, octopus, etc.—but might be surprised to find underwater forms of birds, dragons, people, undead, and so forth. These variations should be the same size as their upper-world

cousins, but with a few differences suitable for their adaptation to the new environment.

The DM might decide to allow special water-breathing creatures to venture into new territory only when conditions permit them to survive normally. Dense fog, pouring rain, deep snow, or other wet weather conditions might permit water creatures to be found wandering nearly anywhere. Snow sharks, their fins breaking through the drifts, might prove quite hazardous to travelers in the winter months. Giant jellyfish might be found floating about on low cloud cover, their tendrils trailing down in the rain, snagging passers-by.

Remember that in adapting monsters to new conditions, the DM is not bound by the limits of our normal world. But the DM should try to find logical reasons within the framework of the fantasy world for why and how these unusual situations come about. Although it may be easier to just toss things in without worrying about reasons or consequences, "rational fantasy" can provide much more entertainment all around.

## Monster Spellcasters

The use of magical spells is not limited to humans and elves. Many humanoid races have their own magic-users, clerics, and even druids. A nonhuman cleric or druid is known as a *shaman*, and a nonhuman magic-user as a *wokan*. Shamans and wokani do not know all the usual spells. The spells they do know they often cast in an unusual manner, involving dancing,

shouts and howls, and waving strange items.

The nonhuman spellcasters that are known are listed below (under "Maximum Spellcaster Ability"), along with the maximum levels attainable by each. Some individuals may be both classes (a shaman/wokan), but then the maximum level for each class is then half what is listed.

Note that most nonhumans in a tribe or lair know nothing of magic, and may fear or distrust it; only the rare shamans and wokani know how to use it. These spellcasters often use their skills to rise to positions of power within their tribes. Only one nonhuman in 20 is a Spellcaster, and many groups have no wokani, only a shaman.

The spells usable by shamans and wokani are listed below (under "Spells Usable by Shamans" and "Spells Usable by Wokani"). Shamans and wokani do not know, and cannot learn, spells other than these. Shamans and wokani cannot read scrolls, but may use other magical items. A shaman can use any clerical item; a wokan can use any item usable by a magic-user.

A shaman or wokan normally has 3-8 hit points per Hit Die ( $1d6 + 2$  instead of  $1d8$ ), and gains a +1 hit point bonus per spellcaster experience level (even if the total exceeds the normal maximum for the monster type).

**Important Note:** The table below, for the most part, does not list monsters that can cast spells as full members of the appropriate character classes—for instance, men, liches, devilfish, sphinxes, etc. Such creatures are not limited to the spell lists for shamans and wokani.

### Notes:

- [a] This monster's special spell-like abilities are *not* affected by the monster having spells.
- [b] Some dragons use magic-user spells, but no single dragon can use both clerical and magic-user spells.
- [c] Manscorpion clerics have access to all clerical spells, and are actually clerics, not shamans.
- [d] A nixie who learns spells of any type is counted as five nixies for purposes of the special nixie charm effect.
- [e] Some very rare and exceptionally intelligent ogres can rise to W12, but these types usually live entirely separated from their normal kin.
- [f] A treant who gains the use of druid spells may animate four trees instead of two.
- [g] At the DM's discretion, a vampire spellcaster can be a full magic-user or cleric, not limited to the shaman/wokan spell lists below.

For example, an ogre could learn magic as a shaman up to 4th level (acting as a 4th level cleric) or as a wokan up to 2nd level (acting as a 2nd

level magic-user); or, he could learn both (acting as a 2nd level cleric and a 1st level magic-user).

## Special Monster Spellcasters

### Lycanthropes

A lycanthrope may be a real magic-user, cleric, or druid in human form. However, it may not use any spells while in were-form and, when it assumes were-form, most lose all memory of spells learned, as if all the spells had been cast. A devil swine spellcaster can cast three *charm person* spells per day in either were or human form, but can only cast other spells while in human form. Devil swine will not forget spells while in were-form: When they return to human form, all their memorized spells are still with them.

### Undead Spellcasters

A spellcaster slain by an undead may retain the use of spells after returning as an undead. Several undead Spellcasters are listed above and in the main Monster List.

If a cleric becomes a mummy (through a process known only to the ancient high priests of certain religions), the undead mummy may use clerical spells to the full extent possessed in life, and may control other undead as well (see Lieges and Pawns). A mummy magic-user is limited to 3rd level ability, even if it had higher level spell use in its previous life.

## Undead Lieges and Pawns

Under certain conditions, intelligent undead creatures can try to control other undead. The undead need not be a spellcaster to control other undead creatures.

An undead creature being controlled by another is a *pawn*. An undead controlling one or more lesser undead is a *liege*. Skeletons and zombies can only be pawns, but any other type of undead can be either a liege or a pawn. Random encounters with undead may occasionally (10% chance) be with pawns controlled by a greater undead creature.

A liege may control a number of undead whose total Hit Dice are less than or equal to twice the liege's Hit Dice. If an attempt by the liege to control other undead would cause the to-

tal to exceed this amount, the attempt automatically fails.

When a lich or other undead spellcaster seeks to control other undead, its *spellcaster level* is used instead of its Hit Dice. Like a magic-user, a lich is far more powerful than its Hit Dice indicate.

### Procedure

If an undead tries to control a potential pawn, the target may have no more than half the Hit Dice of the liege. (This does not apply in certain situations; see below.) If the subject is already controlled by any means, the undead attempting control instantly recognizes this fact. It may still attempt control, but with a -4 penalty to the roll.

If one undead tries to control another, find the Hit Dice of the would-be liege and potential pawn on the following table, and roll 2d6. If the number rolled is equal to or greater than the number given on the table, the attempt succeeds and the undead subject becomes the pawn of the controller. A total of 2 or less (possible if the roll is penalized) always indicates failure.

If the undead attempting control was once a spell-using character and can now use spells as it did in life, a +2 bonus applies to all die rolls to control other undead.

During melee, an attempt to gain control is considered a combat action.

If an undead creates another of the same type by slaying a living creature, the new undead is automatically a pawn of the slayer if the slayer wants it to be. Spectres, vampires, wights, and wraiths are the only undead with this ability. This may force the creator to release other existing pawns; if so, the pawns with the highest Hit Dice are released first. An undead would be wise to release a less-important pawn before the new pawn rises as an undead monster; that way, he can keep the pawns he wants.

If an undead can call or summon others, those responding are automatically its pawns unless the new Hit Dice total would exceed the limits given above, or unless the liege allows them to retain free will.

### Benefits to a Liege

A liege is telepathically linked to its pawns and can see and hear through them whenever it chooses. This communication is at will and need not be continuous.

Control of a pawn is total, even to the point that it will obey suicidal orders: pawns obey without hesitation. The maximum range of control is 24 miles (one outdoor map hex) per Hit Die of the liege.

If a pawn fails a morale check and flees from combat, the liege may stop the pawn and force it back into melee. This can be the only action the liege takes during that melee round. The pawn will miss at least one full round of attacks.

A liege can create a chain of control by instructing its pawns to become lieges too. For example, a spectre could control up to 12 wights, who could each control up to six skeletons. Direct communication and control does not extend through a chain of control, but only to a liege's personal pawns.

Any liege may coordinate the attacks of its pawns in a well-organized fashion. A liege at the top of a chain of control that consists of ten or more undead (counting the entire chain) may be considered the Leader of an undead army. When applying the War Machine mass combat system (see Chapter 9) note the following details for calculating the force's BFR:

1. Leadership Factor: Treat the liege's Wisdom as equal to its Intelligence, and treat Charisma as 18. (see the Intelligence section.)
2. Experience Factor: Treat each controlled liege as an officer.
3. Training Factor: Automatic maximum (52).
4. Equipment Factor: Assume normal weapons.
5. Special Troop Factor: Carefully review the percentage of the force that has two or more asterisks listed with its Hit Dice.

## Turning Controlled Undead

When a character tries to turn pawns, the attempt is checked as if against the liege. If the attempt fails, the pawns are completely unaffected, even if they would normally be turned or destroyed by the result. If the turn succeeds, the control link is broken, but there is no other effect. A second attempt at turning the same group must be made for the former pawns to be turned with normal chances and results.

## Duration of Control

At moonrise on the night of the full moon, all pawns are freed of control and cannot be controlled again until the following dawn. Thus, the maximum continuous duration of undead control is about four weeks. Any liege may release control of its pawns at any time.

## Energy Drainers

Whenever an energy-draining undead (spectre, vampire, wight, wraith) slays a victim, the victim later rises as an undead of the same type, a pawn of the slayer. In this case, the armor class and Hit Dice of the victim become those of the standard undead form, but the hit points are one-half of those possessed in life. (Note that such a victim usually does not rise immediately, but usually after a period of 24 to 72 hours, or as given in each monster description.)

If the liege undead is slain after the victim has risen as a pawn, the victim becomes free-willed and gains 1 hit point per hour until reaching the full number of hit points possessed in life.

If the original undead is slain before its victim can rise as an undead, the victim becomes a free-willed undead instead of a pawn. In this case, the new undead creature has all the hit points of the original living victim (not one-half), and has the same Hit Dice as well. Its armor class and movement rate change to match the new undead form. Such details of these created undead may thus vary widely from the standard monster descriptions. Note that Hit Dice, not levels of experience, remain the same.

If the victim was a cleric or magic-user in life, spells are usable only when the undead is free-willed. An undead cleric must still meditate to gain spells, and an undead magic-user must still keep a spell book to memorize spells. Those clerics who were druids in life revert to normal cleric status in un-death; there are no undead druids.

If a cleric (or paladin or avenger) gains a T or D result when attempting to turn an undead spellcaster, the undead may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect entirely. If successful, the turn attempt is ignored, but is not counted as a failure: The same cleric may make further attempts at turning the same creature.

Any undead spellcaster may be recovered and restored to normal life after it has been slain in undead form. The remains must be treated with a *remove curse* spell from a 26th or higher level cleric, followed by *curseall* and *raise dead* (or *raise dead fully*) spells, in that order.

![Decorative flourish]()![](_page_218_Picture_1.jpeg)

Characters reach higher experience levels, they will become aware of powers even mightier than they, powers beyond mortal ken. The influence of these powers is deeply interwoven with the fabric of campaign events, and it becomes clear that these superior beings manipulate the world, perhaps the entire multiverse, according to their own desires. These beings are the Immortals.

## Immortals and Spheres of Power

Once mortal heroes of legend, the Immortals gained powers and responsibilities beyond worldly concerns. Now Immortals, they subtly manipulate the events of the multiverse to advance their Spheres of Power. Their maneuverings create challenges and epic sagas to test the worth of mortals while furthering the Immortals' own mysterious goals.

Each Immortal serves one Sphere of Power (described below), and the struggle for dominance between the Spheres of Power causes conflict in the campaign.

Each Immortal has his own personal interests, often drawn from his experiences in life. One may be a patron of war, while another may be a patron of the arts. Each Immortal promotes his own personal interests in the mortal world.

Each Immortal is served by an order of clerics. The Immortal provides power (i.e., clerical spells) to his cleric followers, and also gives them guidance (often in the form of the clerical order's long-standing goals, but sometimes by directly or indirectly manipulating the cleric into a specific quest or set of actions).

Each Immortal draws strength from the numbers and devotion of his mortal followers (i.e., the clerics and non-clerics who favor the Immortal and his goals), and so there are also secondary struggles between Immortals who want to lure followers away from one another.

**Note:** Not all clerics serve an Immortal, however. Some serve the less specific concepts of Law, Neutrality, and Chaos, while others serve great non-sentient forces such as Nature.

## The Spheres of Power

The entire multiverse (that is, the combination of all the universes) can be divided into five distinct components, also called Spheres of Power. These five Spheres are Matter, Energy, Time, Thought, and Entropy. Everything in the multiverse is composed of a combination of all five of these components in varying proportions.

Each Immortal serves one of the Spheres, seeking to either increase its influence in the multiverse or to maintain the balance of power among the Spheres. In three of the Spheres (Matter, Energy, and Time), one alignment is dominant; in the other two (Thought, Entropy) no alignment dominates.

The *Sphere of Matter* is closely related to the element of earth. Its purpose is to withstand destruction and decay. This Sphere stands for sturdiness and stability. Matter, in its three forms, is the building block of all things. Even in decay, matter uses the elements to create new forms. Matter is rich in variety and easily mutable to any form. Matter represents the Lawful

alignment (order and form in all) and favors the fighter class. Matter is opposed to Time's efforts to cause change and provides Thought with existing order.

The *Sphere of Energy* is closely related to the element of fire. Its purpose is to create more energy and activity. Energy is highly active, dynamic and excited. It seeks to alter and transform things, consuming matter, slowing time, and exciting thought to release more energy. Highly temperamental, energy is also very creative, channeling magical energies and forming things from the ether. Energy represents the Chaotic alignment (disorder and uniqueness) and favors the magic-user class. Energy is opposed to Thought's efforts to control it and seeks to transform Matter into energy to continue at its highest level despite the ravages of Time.

The *Sphere of Time* is closely related to the element of water. Its purpose is to promote change in all things and to maintain the flow of time. Time is everywhere, ebbing and flowing, recycling the lessons of the past to remind the present. It is a creative, shaping force causing change through aging and rebirth. Time represents the Neutral alignment (seeking change, but also stability through the ages) and favors the cleric and druid classes. Time is opposed to Matter's efforts to withstand change, causes a loss of Energy through time, and teaches Thought the lessons of history.

The *Sphere of Thought* is closely related to the element of air. Its purpose is to categorize all of existence and to make all other Spheres its tools. Thought is the very essence of the Immortals. It is realization, philosophy, and understanding. Thought seeks to analyze everything and can manipulate the other powers of the multiverse. Thought does not represent a single alignment, but is comprised of all alignments. It favors the chief and mystic classes, as the chief lives by his wits and cleverness and the mystic strives to live by philosophy and reason. Thought opposes the chaotic excesses of Energy and attempts to manipulate the effects of Time to create order and form in Matter.

The *Sphere of Entropy or Death* is not related to any element. Its purpose is the ultimate destruction of the multiverse. The four other Spheres of Power oppose Entropy but recognize its importance in the functioning of each of the other Spheres. Entropy is the weakening of the fabric of the multiverse, rot, weathering, and dissipation. It seeks to bring all things to a stop, causing oblivion. At the same time, Entropy itself can not exist without the presence of the other powers, so it seeks first to subjugate before bringing about oblivion. Entropy does not favor any specific class. Entropy seeks to destroy Matter, dissipate Energy, cause Time to stagnate, and stop new Thought.

The multiverse is best served when there is balance between the Spheres of Power. If one should ever gain an overwhelming dominance over the others, only Entropy would win, for balance between all the Spheres is necessary for harmony. Thus, while each Sphere constantly strives to advance and grow, the other Spheres of Power try to maintain the balance by retarding or countering an opposing Sphere's growth.

## Immortals in the Game

Immortals provide challenge for high level characters. Their subtle manipulations lead to campaign events, and the possibility of reaching this status provides characters with a new goal.

An Immortal is a being who cannot die by earthly means. Immortals do not need food, drink, or air. They easily manipulate elements and magical energies while remaining almost totally immune to their effects.

An Immortal's goals are to gain personal power and to advance the influence of his Sphere. Immortals gain power through service to their Sphere: To increase the influence of one's Sphere is also to gain increased power from that Sphere.

The paths of mortals and Immortals cross when service to a Sphere requires Immortals to intervene on the various planes of existence. Immortals have entered the lore and legends of the world through these chance encounters.

The Prime Plane holds special interest for Immortals. It is the only place in which sentient humanoids occupy and manipulate an environment composed of all five Spheres. It is also the only place that reliably produces new Immortals.

Thus, many Immortals visit the Prime Plane with regularity. Once, in the distant past, Immortals lived in the Prime Plane and directly influenced the progress of the sentient races. They later departed, wisely, to preserve the plane's unique environment.

## How the Immortals Interact With Mortals

Mortals on the Prime Plane are dealt with indirectly and through subversion. Immortals do not commonly confront mortals directly.

Immortals do not often appear to mortals in physical form, standing up before them and enjoining them to action. More commonly, an Immortal will appear to one mortal in his dreams, or will inspire a cleric to a prophecy affecting the mortals. On rarer occasions, the Immortal will appear before a party of mortals in his corporeal form (see below).

Immortals usually communicate with mortals in order to command them or persuade them to undertake actions which advance the Immortals' plans. When one Immortal sees an enemy Immortal plotting, the first Immortal will usually communicate information and his desires to a group of faithful clerics or heroic player characters, persuading those heroes to confront the minions of his enemy. The Immortals themselves seldom participate personally in the struggles between their minions.

It's usually not necessary to have a character sheet for an active Immortal; mortal heroes in reasonable campaigns don't often attack them.

However, in certain rare situations, mortal heroes will decide that they have to attack an Immortal. At that point, as a DM, you can choose one of several different responses for the Immortal to take:

(1) The Immortal Overwhelms the PCs: The DM, if he wants Immortals in his campaign to be incredibly powerful beings, can just decide that no mortal player character even approximates

# Chapter 15: The Immortals

the amount of power it takes to hurt an Immortal. Therefore, with this choice, the DM can just describe how the Immortal frowns, waves his arms, and all the PCs are *paralyzed* (no saving throw possible), *cursed*, *ceased*, randomly teleported, or other otherwise discomfited.

(2) The Immortal Leaves: The Immortal might just disappear completely; no mortal magic could bind him here. He could then pursue his punishment of the PCs at his own leisure.

(3) The Immortal Stays and Fights: A particularly foolish Immortal might just stay behind to fight. (It's not foolish for him to believe that he would win a fight; but he risks loss of power, reduction in status, and possible additional punishments if such direct manipulation is unsuccessful.) The DM might have arranged an adventure where some artifact has bound an Immortal in place so that the PCs have a chance at attacking and temporarily or permanently destroying him, so not *all* circumstances where an Immortal stays around to fight necessarily mean that the Immortal is foolish.

## Immortal Behavior

The Immortals have a rule among themselves: *Direct Action Against Mortals is Forbidden*. The wiser ones among them have convinced most of the others that they need to live with this code and enforce it on others who aren't so sensible. And so the Immortals spend a lot of their magical energy "scanning" for the tell-tale emanations of direct Immortal intervention on the mortal planes. An Immortal who just shows up on the mortal world and starts killing the mortals he dislikes will instantly be noticed, and will probably be attacked, by the other Immortals.

This is why Immortals tend to limit themselves to speaking to mortals in dreams, or appearing very briefly and not manifesting very much energy; this is why they try to persuade mortals to their own doctrines and let the mortals do all the work.

Of course, not all Immortals are happy to bow to the will of the masses. Some chafe at the "no direct action" rule and do appear directly whenever they think they can get away with it. Often, it will be in a mortal form (described below), which is no more powerful than a high level player character but is not detectable by the other Immortals. Immortals appear on the Prime Material Plane in their true identities (i.e., in their manifestation forms, described below) usually only in high-energy places and situations where they think the other Immortals will not notice their presence.

When an Immortal appears on the mortal world in his manifestation form, there is a 5% cumulative chance per round that the watching Immortals will notice. If they notice, they will probably decide to yank the erring Immortal back out of the mortal world by force. If he is a lesser Immortal of one of the four "good" Spheres, they may be able to punish him; if he is an Immortal of Entropy, he will not allow himself to be summoned into their presence and will simply escape to cause trouble later on.

## Immortal Manipulations

An Immortal will not generally reveal himself to mortals. Only candidates for future immortal-

ity may normally recognize an Immortal. Instead, Immortals prefer to manipulate their followers' Prime Planes by other means.

One subtle but common way involves the use of omens to presage some great event, encourage an undertaking, or warn of danger. Another common way is to inspire a mortal through mental suggestions or dreams.

When attempting to change the course of history, an Immortal may use more active methods. The most common is the use of a pawn, a servitor or follower of his Sphere of Power—sometimes a PC. A pawn may be given an Immortal artifact and a goal to accomplish and then left to his own means. The pawn faces mortal risk in personally performing the task. A less risky method is for a pawn (usually an NPC) to act as an agent of the Sphere to coach a more powerful character to undertake the Immortal's task. In either case, these are the types of events which drag player characters and the world's most famous, powerful NPCs into the plans of the Immortals.

Immortals from the Sphere of Entropy are the most likely to become personally involved in their plotting, often revealing their true form to their minions, servants, and enemies. No action that would endanger the Prime Plane is ever taken by any Immortal, including one of Entropy.

## Immortal Statistics

Immortals have three basic forms in which they can confront mortals. These are the *mortal* form, the *manifestation* form, and the *incorporeal* form.

## Mortal Form

An Immortal can create any mortal form to house his intelligence when he appears in the mortal world. He can create a mortal form of any monster species, and at the maximum experience level (or HD figure) for that species.

The Immortal is bound by all character class or species limitations of the form he assumes. For example, if an Immortal creates a human form for himself, he can create anything from a normal man to a 36th level adventurer (or 16th level, if he takes a Mystic identity). If, for instance, he were to become a 24th level cleric, he would be bound by the cleric's limitations on spells, armor, and weapons. Violation of any such limitations would force the Immortal to begin to take on either his manifestation or incorporeal form, as described below.

This mortal form is not detectable by other Immortals as an object housing another Immortal. Therefore, the Immortal housed in the mortal form can walk freely among mortals, using all the abilities of his mortal form. Not many Immortals like to do this; becoming Immortal and then later returning to the limitations of a mortal body, to them, is like being cured of blindness and then becoming blind again; also, an Immortal wandering around in a mortal identity can't keep his attention on as many of his plans as he could if he were back on the Immortals' plane. But some do it in order to advance their personal plans or to keep an eye on mortals crucial to their plans.

An Immortal can throw off his mortal form

![Illustration showing a bearded Immortal figure (likely a God or High Elf) with a large hand reaching down towards a mortal figure (a human) who is looking up in fear or awe.]()![](_page_219_Picture_22.jpeg)

and take on his manifestation form or his incorporeal form at any time. But it's not instantaneous; it takes one full turn for the transformation to be completed. During this turn, the Immortal is transforming but has all the stats and limitations of his mortal form.

Likewise, the Immortal can change his mortal form to another mortal form, under the same time constraints. If an Immortal wants to maintain two identities on the mortal world, one of a female 36th level magic-user and the other of a 10th level dwarf, he can change freely between them—and any number of additional forms and identities—and be subject only to the limitation that each transformation takes one turn.

The Immortal may create any garments, weapons, and normal (non-artifact) magical items as possessions for his mortal form. When he changes to another form, all those objects vanish; a hero stealing such an item will watch it disappear into thin air once the Immortal changes forms. And when the Immortal returns to the form which had that item, the item returns to the Immortal—not to the thief.

The mortal form of an Immortal has one special power:

**Communication:** The Immortal can speak with any living creature and with nonliving things related to his own Sphere; he knows all languages.

## Manifestation Form

The Immortal's more powerful form is his manifestation form. This form is as much of his "true" Immortal body as he can project into the mortal world (the Prime Plane). The Immortal can make his manifestation form look like anything, but it will always radiate the power of an Immortal; an Immortal in this form cannot convince anyone that he is not an Immortal.

Most Immortals choose one or two specific appearances for their manifestation forms; this helps when they are dealing with their mortal followers and minions. They can switch instantly between those appearances if they choose.

Three power levels of Immortal are shown below: Lesser, Greater, and Ultimate. The DM will decide which Immortals in his own campaign fall into which power level.

Lesser Immortals are either fairly new to immortality or have simply never developed a lot of power; they tend to be patrons of less-dominant traits or professions (such as sagecraft or youth), patrons of specific cities, or servants of greater Immortals; many of them have few followers.

Greater Immortals are powerful beings who represent important functions and have gained a lot of magical might. They tend to be patrons of significant traits or professions (such as diplomacy or the thief character class), patrons of entire nations or tribes; they often have Lesser Immortal subordinates and sometimes answer to Ultimate Immortals.

Ultimate Immortals are those who are the oldest and most powerful; they often represent very popular or important traits (such as warfare, love, agriculture, etc.) and have many subordinate Immortals and followers.

These divisions are mere conveniences for the DM, who can create Immortals with other statistics and power levels.

### Immortal Manifestation Forms Table

| Immortal          | Type Of Immortal | Ultimate       |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Statistics        | Average          | Greater        |
| Number Appearing: | 1                | 1              |
| Armor Class:      | 0                | -10            |
| Hit Dice:         | 15               | 4              |
| Hit Points:       | 100              | 250            |
| Move:             | 60' (20')        | 60' (20')      |
| Flying:           | 150' (50')       | 150' (50')     |
| Attacks:          | 2                | 3              |
| Damage:           | 2d6 or special   | 4d6 or special |
| Save As:          | M36              | M36            |
| Anti-Magic:       | 50% to 5'        | 60% to 5'      |
| Morale:           | 12               | 12             |
| Treasure Type:    | n/a              | n/a            |
| Alignment:        | Varies           | Varies         |

Note that the morale score *doesn't* mean that an Immortal will stay and fight to the death in any combat; though that's what a morale of 12 means for monsters, that's not what it means here. The Immortal morale score of 12 merely means that Immortals never fail morale rolls, under those rare circumstances when they have to make such rolls.

Most Immortals will not bother to conduct combat with mortals; more often, they vanish from the scene of combat, preferring to visit revenge on their enemies later, and at their convenience. Those who do stay to fight will certainly not fight to the death, and will instead disappear once they've taken 25% of their hit points in damage.

Whenever an Immortal's form is destroyed on the Prime Plane, the Immortal usually arranges for its utter destruction. At worst, the form would leave clues about the existence and activities of the Immortals, and powerful mortals could seriously interfere with Immortal plans if sufficiently aroused.

#### Manifestation Form Special Powers

**Anti-Magic:** See Chapter 13 under "Anti-Magic." Manifestation form Anti-Magic is of the radiated (non-attack) variety, and so it primarily effects temporary magical items and effects (such as spells).

**Aura Attack:** When the Immortal decides to make an *aura attack* (which is usually done to impress his followers and their friends, or to terrify his enemies), all victims within 60' of the manifestation form must make saving throw vs. spells, receiving no bonuses from equipment, spell effects, or Wisdom score; if the saving throw fails, the victim is *awed*. The Immortal can then decide whether the victim feels terror (treat as a *fear* spell of three turns duration), *paralysis* (lasting three turns; see the description of paralysis in Chapter 13, under "Special Character Conditions"), or *charm* (treat as a *charm* spell of 2 x normal duration). The manifestation form can make one *aura attack* per round, but normally limits himself to only one per encounter.

**Communication:** The Immortal can speak with any living creature and with nonliving things related to his own Sphere; he knows all languages.

**Magic Use:** The manifestation form can use any clerical, druidic, or magical spell as a spell-caster whose level is 2 x the Immortal's HD (thus M30 if he's an Lesser Immortal, or M36 if

he's at Greater or Ultimate levels); he can vary spell duration as he pleases; he does not need spell books, and does not forget magic-user spells as he uses them (and so could cast the same spell over and over).

**Regenerates:** The manifestation form regenerates 1 hit point per day. If hurt, the Immortal usually casts healing magic on himself.

**Special Defense:** The manifestation form can only be hit by a +5 or greater enchanted weapon, or by an artifact; when damaged, he takes only the minimum damage possible (i.e. if damage is 2d6 + 3 points, the Immortal takes 5 points of damage).

**Special Defense vs. Mortal Magic:** The manifestation form is immune to all mortal spells.

**Special Defense vs. Poison:** Manifestation forms automatically make all saving throws vs. poisons.

**Travel Powers:** The manifestation form has the power to fly at will, *teleport* without error once per hour, and travel ethereally and astrally one time each per day.

## Incorporeal Form

The Immortal's third form is his incorporeal form. This form is really just a projection of his mind from his native Sphere to the mortal world; it usually appears as a glowing, insubstantial figure, or can take the form of any sort of dream projected straight into a mortal's mind. In either case, the Immortal can appear before (or in the dreams of) several mortals all at once, or can be visible to (or in the dream of) only one, as the Immortal chooses.

The appearance of an incorporeal form on the mortal world does not alert watching Immortals. Therefore, an Immortal can freely communicate with his minions without alerting other Immortals to his activities.

Mortal magic has absolutely no effect on the incorporeal form. No amount of spells cast on the incorporeal form will hurt the Immortal. On the other hand, the incorporeal form cannot cast any spells against mortals.

The incorporeal form can change into either the manifestation form or the mortal form after a transformation of one turn.

## Fighting Immortals

Immortals do not exist in the D&D® game for player characters to fight or kill. They're sup-

# Chapter 15: The Immortals

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_221_Picture_2.jpeg)

posed to be powerful forces which confound, influence, and aid player characters . . . not as "monsters" to be attacked and killed, their homes looted for treasure.

However, it could happen that the PCs will find themselves fighting Immortals. Should this happen, here are some basic guidelines.

## Mortal Form

If an Immortal's mortal form is killed on the Prime Plane, the Immortal is banished back to his own plane for 1d20 days. He may only reappear on the Prime Plane in his incorporeal form during this period of banishment.

## Manifestation Form

If the Immortal's manifestation form is killed on the Prime Plane, his spirit returns to his home plane and forms a new manifestation form in a number of days equal to his Immortal hit points. During this time, he may only reappear on the mortal world in his incorporeal form.

Immortals on their own plane are automatically in their manifestation form. If this form is killed on the Immortal's own plane, the Immortal is forever dead. However, not even the stupidest or most violent of Immortals would fail to use teleport abilities to get to a safer haven, or (if they have a full turn available to them) can revert to their incorporeal form, and send their minions after any PCs crazy enough to attack them.

## Incorporeal Form

The incorporeal form cannot be killed or harmed in any way.

## PCs Becoming Immortals

Since all Immortals were once mortal, the DM may permit characters to seek Immortality by taking the winding journey into heroic legend. It is not easy to gain Immortality, and most never succeed. But the truly persistent and heroic character may gain Immortality if he proves worthy enough. However, if he gains Immortality, it is likely that the character will retire from the realm of the living and never be heard of again.

Immortality must be won. It can only be earned by successfully completing several extremely difficult tasks.

There are four paths to Immortality, each corresponding to one of the four elemental Spheres of Power. Any intelligent mortal reaching his ultimate experience level may try to earn immortality. However, only humans may attempt to become an Immortal of the Sphere of Matter.

## Prerequisites

A human character of the cleric, fighter, magic-user, thief or druid class must first reach 30th level, and a demi-human or mystic must first reach an experience point total of 1,000,000 points to be a candidate for Immortality. Once these levels are attained, the character may begin research to discover the paths to Immortality.

These paths are not common knowledge. The DM should put the character through a grueling adventure during which the PC learns what is required of a candidate for Immortality.

Every path to Immortality begins with the following steps. Make sure to review the details of

the various paths before a character decides which path to pursue.

1. The character selects the path for the Sphere of Power he wants to serve. (Though each Sphere of Power favors a specific character class, a character of *any* class may try to achieve Immortality with *any* Sphere.)
2. The character must find an Immortal sponsor—i.e., choose the Immortal he hopes to be his sponsor, and try to persuade that Immortal to guide him to Immortality.

## Finding a Sponsor

Finding an Immortal and petitioning for sponsorship is but the first of many difficult tasks.

The character must set out on another adventure of research to locate the place where the Immortal he has chosen may be contacted. This could be at the top of a remote mountain with a reputation for dangerous hazards, in a mystic grove surrounded by deep forest teeming with monsters, in a trench at the bottom of the sea, or in a perfectly safe temple . . . one it took several dangerous adventures to find.

## The Gift

Once the location for petition has been determined, the character must create a gift of particular relevance to the Sphere or personality of the Immortal. This gift should be especially beautiful and have the qualities of the Sphere. The more valuable the gift, the higher the chances for the character to receive a favorable response from the Immortal; a minimum value of 25,000 gold pieces is recommended, but not required.

When the gift is prepared, the character may embark on the journey to the mountain. This journey should be very dangerous; the character should rise one level or gain 120,000 experience points during his journey, and the character may be distracted by many adventures along the way. He must take care that the gift is not damaged or stolen. If it is, the damage must be repaired or the item recovered before he continues.

## The Seven Tests

Climbing the mountain to its summit should also be challenging. It is recommended that the DM create seven encounters that must be met in climbing the mountain. The encounters should test the character's mettle and worth in the following:

- Honor and trustworthiness.
- Dedication to the Sphere of Power.
- Resourcefulness and resolution without combat.
- Bravery.
- Persistence in the face of adversity.
- Mercy and charity of the heart.
- Wisdom.

Not all these encounters need be combat-related; in fact, most should be role-playing encounters where the character must make the correct decision based on the trait being tested. Not every challenge must be won to reach the summit, but they must all be met.

## Immortal Response

Once the summit is reached, the character must meditate for 1d6 days, calling to the Im-

mortal in his thoughts. The Immortal will always hear the call but will judge the character's worthiness before responding. To check for the Immortal's response, roll 1d10 and modify as in the following table.

### Immortal Responses Table

#### Modifiers

- -5 If the character is of a different alignment
- -3 Per additional being accompanying the character
- -3 Per test failed in climbing the mountain
- +1 Per test passed
- +1 If a minor artifact is brought
- +2 If a lesser artifact is brought
- +4 If a greater artifact is brought
- +8 If a major artifact is brought

Treat results of less than 1 as 1 and results of greater than 10 as 10.

#### Results

- 1-2 The Immortal is displeased and lets the character know (by an omen in 1d6 days) that he will not answer the call.
- 3-8 The Immortal arrives in d100 days. He sends an omen of his impending arrival in 1d4 days.
- 9-10 The Immortal is very pleased and arrives in 1d6 days.

While awaiting the Immortal's arrival, the character should remain on the summit and meditate for 80% of his waking hours. If the character leaves the mountain, check the Immortal's response again with a —2 modifier. If the Immortal responds, he sends an omen to tell the character to return to the mountain. If the second result is 9 or 10 (see above), the Immortal will appear wherever the character is at the end of the waiting time, but not while the character is in the company of anyone else.

## The Meeting

The arrival of an Immortal is always a performance. This arrival may be grandiose or mysterious. If grandiose, the Immortal appears in an elemental form based on his Sphere.

### Sphere Elemental Forms

- Matter: Erupting from the earth or as any mortal creature
- Energy: Fiery, bright, or on rays of light
- Time: Watery being or as a storm
- Thought: Wild and windy

The Immortal, in his first appearance, will automatically utilize the *paralysis* aspect of his aura *attack* ability on all mortals in the area. He may release creatures from this paralysis at will.

The Immortal examines the character and then communicates verbally or telepathically, asking what the character wants. The character must explain his desires humbly and present his gift. To determine the Immortal's response, roll 1d10 and use the above modifiers plus the following:

- — 5 If the character is haughty.
- - 2 If the gift's value is less than 25,000 gp.
- + 1 If the petitioner is of the character class favored by the Immortal's Sphere of Power.
- + 1 If the gift's value is 25,000 gp or more.
- + 1 For each doubling of the gift's value beyond 25,000 (+ 2 if 50,000 gp; + 3 if 100,000 gp, and so on).

Again, treat all results of less than 1 as 1 and results of greater than 10 as 10.

### Petition Responses Table

| 1-2  | Petition Rejected. Immortal destroys the gift and sets the character a quest before he can return to petition again.                                          |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3-8  | Petition Accepted.                                                                                                                                            |
| 9-10 | Petition Accepted With Pleasure. Immortal gives the character a small magical item of the Sphere of Power as a token and <i>teleports</i> the character home. |

Whatever the response, the Immortal will take (or destroy) the gift.

If the Immortal accepts the character's petition, he instructs the character in the steps required to complete the path to Immortality. Details of these steps follow. The Immortal answers most of the character's questions if they are reasonable. He then sets the conditions for the next meeting and leaves as if he was never there.

Once an Immortal leaves, he will not be seen again until the path is completed or the character returns to petition again. From this point on, the Immortal (though unseen) is instrumental in placing obstacles and challenges in the character's path.

## The Four Paths

Once a character gains a sponsor, he must reach his highest-possible experience level before setting off on the path to Immortality. The questor must be true to his chosen Sphere of Power and bring it glory and honor during the trials.

Each path requires that a mortal pass the following five tough requirements:

1. The character's adventures must gain him a specific amount of experience. This amount is 600,000 XP for most classes but only 400,000 XP for the class the Sphere favors.
2. The character must complete a new quest to retrieve an artifact of lesser or greater magnitude from his Sphere of Power. The quest for this artifact should take several game years.
3. The character must successfully complete a trial of specific value to his class and the Sphere (see below).
4. The character must prepare a testimonial to his greatness, a combination of followers (people devoted to his philosophies and achievements) and a lasting monument. The monument to his greatness must be financed by the character, and he must participate in its creation by either adventuring for components and manpower or by taking the risks of the actual physical construction.
5. The character must complete a specific monumental task that will benefit his Sphere (see below for details).

At the end of these steps, the character must return to the place he met his sponsor and again meet with that Immortal. If the character has failed to complete any of the steps, the Immortal may set further requirements to be fulfilled before Immortality is granted.

If all of the steps are completed, the Immortal reviews the whims of chance. Roll 1d10. If a 1 is rolled, the character has failed and is not granted Immortality. He may request further tasks, or he may give up.

If the character is granted Immortality, he may take a year to complete his mortal affairs and then must leave the Prime Plane to join the struggles of the cosmos.

The four paths to immortality are:

### Dynast

This is the route to the Sphere of Time. This path favors clerics and druids.

**Quest:** The character must undertake a quest for an artifact that will allow him to travel through time.

**Trial:** The character must travel ahead in time to three separate periods and help three different descendants to retain their kingdoms and perpetuate the dynasty.

**Testimony:** The character must create a realm with a population of at least 50,000 people if a human or 10,000 if demihuman. He must also design and build a great new capital for his land.

**Task:** The character must found a dynasty. The dynasty must be ruled by the character and his or her descendants for at least 20 years of the character's life. At the end of this time, the character must have a living grandchild to inherit the dynasty. This grandchild may be adopted instead of a blood relative but must be announced as the heir. During the 20 years, the character should face at least four major challenges to his rule.

### Epic Hero

This is the route to the Sphere of Thought. This path favors the thief and mystic classes.

**Quest:** The Epic Hero must undertake a quest for a major artifact from the Sphere of Thought.

**Trial:** The Epic Hero must track down and bring about the permanent destruction of an artifact of the Sphere of Entropy.

**Testimony:** The Epic Hero must find and train a successor. The successor must be the player character of a different player. In addition, an Epic Hero must create a new legendary weapon.

**Task:** The Epic Hero must live up to the heroic ideals of courage, steadfastness, and dedication. He must complete an epic quest to perform a nearly impossible task, such as driving all dragons from the land or building a castle in the sky. This quest should take about five years to complete.

### Paragon

This is the route to the Sphere of Energy. This path favors the magic-user class.

**Quest:** The Paragon must quest for a lesser artifact of the Sphere of Energy.

**Trial:** The Paragon must create an entirely new magical item. The cost of the research to create such an item equals the total experience points of the character. The components to make the item should be extremely rare and difficult to find, including at least one impossible item (the footfall of a cat or the roar of a lion). The player

must be creative in devising a means to acquire this item.

**Testimony:** The Paragon must recruit at least six apprentices and they must rise at least 12 levels while in his service. He must also transform the land for 100 miles around his home. This transformation must give the land a unique appearance and range of inhabitants.

**Task:** A Paragon must be acknowledged the superior of all other magic-users within a 1,000 mile radius. He may accomplish this through magical duels or by driving all other magic-users out of his lands. The character should challenge at least eight magic users of 25th level or greater. These magic users may team up against the Paragon.

### Polymath

This is the path to the Sphere of Matter. This path favors the fighter class.

**Quest and Task:** The Polymath must face the challenge to succeed in three additional lives as cleric, thief, and magic-user. The Polymath, during each of his three lives as another character class, must quest for and gain the same artifact. He begins each new career at first level, with no memories of his previous lives. The quests may not begin until the character reaches 5th level in each class. The first two times the artifact is gained, the Immortal reappears to the character within 1d20 x 10 days to claim it. The Immortal then reduces the character to first level and causes him to forget his past so that he may begin as the next character class. The third time the artifact is gained, the character may retain it, and the Immortal returns all past memories.

**Trial:** After completing the final step of the quest, the character must adventure alone until he reaches 12th level. He retains the abilities of all the character classes and advances in all classes equally.

**Testimony:** The Polymath must be accompanied on his adventures by one member of each human character class. These comrades may not begin at a level higher than the character. If any of these characters are slain, the aspiring Polymath must take steps to resurrect them, setting aside his quest if necessary. Once the quest is completed and before beginning the trial, the character must erect a monument at least 100 feet tall to the glory of his adventures. This monument must stand for at least ten years.

## When PCs Reach Immortality

If a character reaches Immortality, he must retire from the play of the game . . . unless the campaign focus changes to follow the Immortals and their activities. (This normally only takes place when two or more PCs have become Immortals.) Immortal former PCs may reappear in the campaign as a patron—and sometimes manipulator—of their old friends.

# Chapter 16: Treasure

![](_page_223_Picture_1.jpeg)

The coins, gems, jewelry, and magical items found by player characters during an adventure are all called *treasure*. Treasure is normally found in die lairs of monsters—it may be gained as payment or as a reward from an NPC for performing some task. As characters become more experienced and explore more dangerous areas, treasure is better guarded, better hidden, and possibly trapped. But there is usually more of it, too!

The DM should be careful when placing treasure because treasure helps determine the rate at which characters gain experience.

## Dividing Treasure

Before play starts, players should agree on how they intend to divide up treasure from each adventure. Note that the D&D® game has no hard-and-fast rule for how players should divide their characters' treasure. That decision is best left to each gaming group.

As a basic rule to keep in mind, however, the division of treasure should *not* be based on the amount of work done by different characters. Fighters will usually be more active than others, and thieves may have little to do; though the thief's player may play his role well, there may be few traps and locks to deal with. But each character risked danger in search of treasure, and each did special work as needed; the character should not be penalized if his special skills were seldom needed in this adventure. Don't adjust treasure shares because one character was unable to do much this time around; in the next adventure, he may be the key player.

## Magical Treasure

The presence of magical treasure in a hoard often complicates the process of dividing treasure. Typically, characters divide magical treasure among themselves first, and those who receive magical treasure receive less normal treasure. As a rule of thumb, permanent magical items (such as a magical sword or ring) are considered worth more than temporary magical items (such as a potion or scroll); items that are temporary but that can be used many times (such as a magical wand) are usually counted as permanent items unless the spell they cast is of little significance or usefulness.

### Dividing by Mutual Consent

Party members may come to a consensus on who should get what, all without rolling. For example, if the characters capture a treasure hoard that includes a magical sword and two of the party's fighters already have magical swords while the third does not, they may simply decide that the third fighter gets it. If the hoard includes a magical ring that bears the family crest of one of the character's clans, they may think it only right that this character get the ring.

The name of the group is cooperation, not competition, and members of most groups should remember when they're dividing treasure that their characters are supposed to be *friends or allies*. Individual group dynamics do vary, of course, but the PCs are supposed to help, not compete with, one another.

## Choosing Treasures

In this section and in the next several sections, the DM will read methods for choosing which treasures to appear in his or her game. Most treasures, of course, are associated with a monster—the treasure is the treasure in the monster's lair or it is the treasure the monster carries with it most of the time.

There are two ways to determine what sort of treasure belongs to a monster: deliberately and randomly.

### Deliberate Treasure Choice

The DM can simply decide what sort of treasure each monster has by going through the lists of treasure on the following pages and selecting monetary treasure and magical items. It is recommended, however, that the amounts of treasure chosen fall within the ranges and types listed for the monster's "Treasure Type." Therefore, become familiar with the guidelines for random treasure choice, explained in the following section, to help determine how much and which types of treasure to choose.

### Random Treasure Choice

To determine a monster's treasure at random, use the step-by-step procedure outlined in the Random Treasure Checklist.

# Chapter 16: Treasure

## Random Treasure Checklist

1. Find the monster's treasure type. This is listed in the statistics information given for each monster in Chapter 14. Each treasure type lists a letter or a combination of letters.
2. Look at the Treasure Types Tables (both Treasure in Lairs and Treasure Carried). Find the lines corresponding to the treasure type letter codes. Read across the lines to find the possible types of treasure present. (Note that both parts of each table should be checked for treasure possibilities.) Each type will give a percentage, followed by a range of numbers.
3. Roll 1d100 against the chance shown in each column. If the number shown or less is rolled, this type of treasure is in the trove. (Go to Step 4.) If the roll is above the percentage chance given, there is no treasure of this type in the trove. If "nil" is listed, this type of treasure is automatically not included in the hoard; don't roll anything.
4. Determine the amount of each treasure present. For instance, if the column is for "1,000s of gp" and the roll listed is "2d6," roll 2d6 and multiply the result by 1,000 to get the amount of gold pieces present.
5. If the die rolls from Part 2 of both Treasure Types Tables indicate gems, jewelry, or special treasure, see the appropriate value tables in the following sections for those items' worth. If magical items are present, roll for the exact items using the appropriate Magical Items Subtables.

## Modifying Results

If rolls give an amount of treasure that is too much or too little, adjust the result. Always take the number of monsters encountered into consideration and make such adjustments carefully, especially when increasing treasure awarded, because most of the experience the characters will get will be from treasure.

## Treasure in Lairs vs. Treasure Carried

When the treasure type given is a letter from A to O, that treasure is *only* found in the monster's lair (and only if the lair is found, naturally). When the treasure type given is from P to V, the treasure is carried by the monster. This difference is reflected in the use of two Treasure Types Tables—one for Treasure in Lairs and one for Treasure Carried.

## Determining Treasure Example

Let's say that a DM has set up a nest of rocs in the player characters' path. She notes all the monster characteristics on her map key and also notes that rocs have treasure type "I" only, which means that they have lair treasure but that they carry no personal treasure. She will have no need to refer to Treasure Types Table: Treasure Carried.

On Treasure Types Table: Treasure in Lairs, however, she checks the line for treasure type "I." The chance for most types of coins is "nil," so she doesn't have to roll for these columns. But there's a 30% chance of there being platinum

pieces—she rolls a 15 on a 1d100, so there will be platinum. She then rolls a 6 on 1d8 as shown in the entry, so the lair has 6,000 platinum pieces in it. (Remember that Part 1 of the Treasure in Lairs table is pieces in thousands.)

Checking Part 2 of the Treasure in Lairs table, she sees that there's a 50% chance of the lair containing gems; she rolls a 33 on 1d100, so there will be gems. She rolls 2d6, as shown on the table, to find that there will be four gems in the trove. (She'll have to skip down to the section on gems to find out what kind and how valuable they are, as listed in the Gem Value Table.)

There's also a 50% chance of jewels in the lair; she rolls a 53 on 1d100, so there won't be any jewels.

There's only a 5% chance of there being special treasure in the lair. She rolls a whopping 98 on 1d100, so there definitely won't be any special treasure. Finally, there's a 15% chance of there being a magical item in the trove; she rolls a 28 on 1d100 so no magic is present.

The treasure in the rocs' nest: 6,000 pp and four gems. The DM chooses to check the value of the gems right away. She rolls 1d100 for each of the four gems, rolling a 23, 54, 61, and 97. As

# Chapter 16: Treasure

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_225_Picture_2.jpeg)

noted in the Gem Value Table, the gems' total value is 12,100 gp. That puts the total value of this treasure trove at 18,100 gp.

## Average Treasure Values

The average value of each treasure type (in gp) is given in the Average Treasure Values Table. The values represent the amount of gold a typical horde of treasure is worth if all rolls are average. These averages do not include the value of magical items that might be in the treasures. After rolling for treasure, the DM may refer to this table to see whether the treasure is larger or smaller than average.

Average Treasure Values Table

| Type | gp     | Type | gp     |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| A    | 17,000 | H    | 60,000 |
| B    | 2,000  | I    | 7,500  |
| C    | 750    | J    | 25     |
| D    | 4,000  | K    | 250    |
| E    | 2,500  | L    | 225    |
| F    | 7,600  | M    | 50,000 |
| G    | 25,000 |      |        |

## Coins

All coins are about equal in size and weight. Each coin weighs about 1/10 of a pound. In the D&D® game, "cp" stands for copper pieces, "sp" for silver pieces, "ep" for electrum pieces, "gp" for gold pieces, and "pp" for platinum pieces. (Electrum is a mixture of silver and gold whose value falls between the two.)

The rate of exchange between coins is as follows:

$$100 \text{ cp} = 10 \text{ sp} = 2 \text{ ep} = 1 \text{ gp} = 1/5 \text{ pp} \text{ or} \\ 500 \text{ cp} = 50 \text{ sp} = 10 \text{ ep} = 5 \text{ gp} = 1 \text{ pp}$$

## Gems

For convenience's sake, all gems have the same encumbrance value: one gem equals 1 cn of encumbrance. This is not so much a function of the gem's weight as of the gem's size and irregular shape, which make it inconvenient for carrying.

Whenever a gem of unusual size is mentioned, the DM can still presume that the gem does not exceed the 1-cn encumbrance figure. (In real-world terms, a gem would have to weigh 248 *carats* to equal the actual weight of an average game coin!)

To determine the value of a gem found in a treasure, roll percentage dice (1d100) and refer to the Gem Value Table. Note: If the average character level is under 9th level, subtract 10 from the 1d100 roll, treating any modified result less than 01 as 01.

There are two ways to tell the players about the gems they've found. The DM can say, "You've found a gem worth 100 gp," and not be concerned about the gem type or quality. Or the DM can say (for example), "You've found a lovely, carved piece of coral," and let the characters discover its exact value later—at the town jeweler's shop, say, probably for a small fee (usually 1% of the gem's value). If the optional general skills rules are being used, a character could have the Profession skill and have chosen his profession to be an assessor, which would allow him to make a skill roll to calculate a gem's worth.

## Gem Value Table

| 1d100 | Value   | Examples                             |
|-------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| 01-03 | 10      | Agate, quartz, turquoise             |
| 04-10 | 50      | Crystal, jasper, onyx                |
| 11-25 | 100     | Amber, amethyst, coral, garnet, jade |
| 26-46 | 500     | Quamarinne, pearl, topaz             |
| 47-71 | 1,000   | Carbuncle, opal                      |
| 72-90 | 5,000   | Emerald, ruby, sapphire              |
| 91-97 | 10,000  | Diamond, jacinth                     |
| 98-00 | Special | Starstone*, tristal**                |

\* Starstone: Any gem of 1,000 gp value or more (from carbuncle to jacinth, except for diamonds) may be found with a star-like formation in its center. These are often called by their individual names (Star Ruby, Star Sapphire, etc.) and are, as a group, called *starstones*. A Starstone has twice the value of its normal gem type.

\*\* Tristal: Corundum, a mineral, is the substance of which rubies and emeralds are made. It may also be found in other colors, rare and usually transparent: golden yellow, deep violet, and brilliant orange. These gems are known as *tristals*. A tristal may have any value the DM chooses from 1,000 to 100,000 gp, but the average tristal is worth 50,000 gp.

## Variable Gem Size and Quality

Gems are generally presumed to be of average quality and size, but the DM can vary the value and size of individual gems as he or she sees fit by using the Variable Gem Size and Quality Table. It is best to do this with no more than 5% of a treasure's gems; otherwise it becomes very complicated to keep track of a trove's value.

On the Variable Gem Size and Quality Table, roll a 1d10 and find the modification to the gem (size, quality, or both). If only size or quality is affected, roll another 1d10, find the appropriate variation in the latter half of the table, and note the gem's new value. If both size and quality are affected, roll a 1d10 twice—reading the first number for the size variation and the second for the quality.

Gem value for a gem that has been modified by size or quality only is self-explanatory. (See

the Gem Value Table for the values given for normal gems.) However, if a gem has been modified by both size and quality, the size and quality gem value results are multiplied.

For example, a pearl modified by a die roll of 4 would be of fairly small size (gem value 1/2 normal). (As noted on the Gem Value Table, the value of a typical, normal pearl is 500 gp.) If the die roll for quality is a 10, however, the pearl is of very good quality (gem value 8 x normal). The pearl, though small, is exquisite nonetheless, with a value of 2,000 gp  $1/2 \times 8 = 4 \times 500 = 2,000$  gp).

## Damaged Gems

The DM may also modify the value of gems if they are subjected to harsh treatment after they have been collected. For example, most gems will shatter if struck. Gems may crack or shatter because of normal fire or certain spells (*fireball, lightning bolt*, etc.). All effects are left to the DM's discretion; a cracked gem is worth 20-50% ( $1d4 + 1 \times 10$ ) of the original value. A shattered gem might leave a small piece worth 5-10% ( $1d6 + 4$ ) of the original; however, the powdered remnants may still be of value to NPC magic-users, who may need gem powder for potions, scrolls, rare inks, etc.

## Optional Rules

The DM should feel free to use the following time-saving optional rules when placing gems in treasure hoards.

Rearrange Gem Treasures: After finding the total value of all the gems in a treasure, the DM may combine or split them into different numbers of gems adding up to the same gp values. For example, 5 gems worth 100 gp each could be changed to 1 pearl (worth 500 gp); 10 onyx gems (each worth 50 gp); or 4 garnets (worth 100 gp apiece) and 10 pieces of turquoise (each worth 10 gp).

Roll for Groups of Gems: When several gems are found together, the DM doesn't have to make a separate roll for each and every gem. Instead, he or she can divide the trove of gems into groups of three to five gems each, rolling once for each group. This is quite useful for dragon treasure (Type H, Gems: 50% 1d100) as well as other heavy-gem treasures.

## Variable Gem Size and Quality Table

| 1d10       | Modification     |         |            |
|------------|------------------|---------|------------|
| 1-4        | Size             |         |            |
| 5-8        | Quality          |         |            |
| 9-10       | Size and quality |         |            |
| Variation: |                  |         |            |
| 1d10       | Size             | Quality | Gem Value* |
| 1          | Very small       |         | 1/8normal  |
| 2-3        | Small            |         | 1/4normal  |
| 4-5        | Fairly small     |         | 1/2normal  |
| 6-7        | Fairly large     |         | 2 x normal |
| 8-9        | Large            |         | 4 x normal |
| 10         | Very large       |         | 8 X normal |

\* "Normal" gem values are given in the Gem Value Table.

## Jewelry

To find the value of a piece of jewelry, roll 1d100 on the Jewelry Value Table. If the average party level is less than 9th level, subtract 10 from the 1d100 roll, treating any roll less than 01 as 01.

The value of each piece of jewelry should be determined separately, except when large numbers are found such as in treasure types A (50% 6d6) and H (50% 1d4 X 10). When several pieces are found together, the DM can divide them into groups of three to five items each and then make one roll for each group. After the DM finds the value of the jewelry, he or she can select or randomly determine a type for each piece using the Jewelry Type Table.

All pieces of jewelry are made of valuable metals, gems, and/or other treasured material (such as ivory, ebony, fur, etc.). Their values may vary by up to 15% above or below the amount given on the table if the DM chooses to modify them. (For example, a piece listed as 20,000 gp could be given any value from 17,000 to 23,000 gp.) If the DM decides to vary the value, he can roll 1d6. A 1-3 means that the value is less than that listed, and a 4-6 means that the value is greater than that listed. The DM can roll 1d6 again. A 1-2 means that the difference is 15%, a 3-4 means the difference is 10%, and a 5-6 means the difference is 5%.

Of course, the DM may choose to allow jewelry of greater value than that given. And when both gems and jewelry occur in the same treasure, the DM may combine them. For example, a single gem with a value of 1,000 gp along with a necklace valued at 1,500 gp could be changed to "two gold crowns, each with a large pearl set in its front, and each is worth 1,250 gp."

## Types of Jewelry

To find the type of jewelry (necklace, non-magical ring, etc.), roll 1d10 on the Jewelry Type Table and go down the column that the value of the item falls in (previously determined on the Jewelry Value Table). For instance, if a 95 was rolled on the Jewelry Value Table (resulting in a jewel worth 30,000 gp), the DM would roll 1d10 and check the "15,000-50,000" column on the Jewelry Type Table. Say a 4 was rolled: the DM would have a medallion worth 30,000 gp.

# Chapter 16: Treasure

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_227_Picture_2.jpeg)

## Damaged Jewelry

Jewelry can quite easily be damaged by such things as very hot fire, lightning bolts, crushing, and other rough treatment. Damaged jewelry is worth only half normal value.

The gems found in certain types of jewelry are subject to the guidelines given above for damaged gems. Note also that the value of jewelry is because of its fine craftsmanship, not necessarily the parts; any rough treatment can result in the loss of 10-80% ( $1d8 \times 10$ ) of the value.

## Special Treasure

The DM may decide to place unusual but valuable treasure in a trove. The Special Treasure Value Table gives guidelines that may be used to determine the value of such items. A DM may find it more appropriate to deliberately select such items (rather than determine them randomly) so that he can place them in areas where they might reasonably be found, with some logical explanation for their appearance.

## Magical Items

Magical items are divided into two camps: *permanent* items, which are not used up (such as swords and armor), and *temporary* items, which are used either once (such as potions) or for a certain number of times (such as some wands). Many temporary items have a limited number of charges or uses. When the last charge is used, the item is no longer magical. It is impossible for a character to find out how many charges an item has, and such items can only rarely be recharged.

The only way characters can identify what an item does is by testing it (trying on the ring, sipping the potion, etc.). This can be dangerous as some magical items have been cursed or poisoned.

If a hireling is ordered to do this testing, he has the right to expect to keep the item. If the PCs use their hirelings to test magical items but don't allow them to keep the items, the PCs' reputation as employers will be seriously damaged. The DM should let the players know that their characters are suffering because of their bad reputation as employers.

### Using Magical Items

Characters must properly use magical items if the magic is to have any effect. For example, a magical shield will have no effect if it is slung across a character's back (it must be carried normally on a character's arm), and a ring cannot be used when carried in a pocket (it must be worn on a finger for its magic to be in effect).

Some protective magical items are always active when worn; the character does not have to concentrate on them to use them. For example, medallions that prevent use of *ESP* always work when worn around the neck.

All temporary items are either consumed (when they are drunk or eaten, for example) or are used more gradually. If a magical item is not the type that is consumed, the user must hold the item and concentrate on it in order to use it. While using the item, the user may not move, cast a spell, or take any other action during that round. The use of the magical item takes place during the magic phase of the combat round.

### Limitations on Magical Effects

The following should be noted when a magical item is being used.

Ranges and Durations: If the range or duration of the effect produced by a magical item is not given, treat it as if it were cast by a 6th level spellcaster.

Insulation: Several items can detect, control, or perform actions within a given range. These actions can be blocked by a thin sheet of lead, other metal 1" thick, or stone 10" thick.

### Cursed Items

Any treasure can hold a cursed magical item. A *curse* can be removed for a short time ( $1d20$  rounds) by any *remove curse* spell, but it can only be permanently removed by the same spell from a high-level cleric or magic-user ( $15th$  level or above is recommended). A cleric's *dispel evil* spell should remove nearly all curses, except perhaps those bestowed by either very powerful spellcasters or items; these would require a *dispel evil* or *remove curse* cast by a 36th level spell-caster. A wish may be used at any time to remove a *curse*; treat the *wish* as a powerful *remove curse* at 36th level magic use.

The curse on an item may have nearly any effect imaginable. A *sword* +2 might be cursed to act as a *sword* -2 (penalizing the attack roll); a *shield* +3 could likewise have the reverse effect, penalizing the user's armor class by 3. Cursed items could work normally but have side effects, causing the wielder to sneeze, drop items, etc.

Magical treasures are rare and valuable; the DM should make it possible for characters to remove any curse and free the item for proper use. The removal of a powerful curse, however, may involve a quest or some other service for the NPC spellcaster removing a curse.

### Using the Magical Items Main Table

When a roll for treasure on the two Treasure Types Tables indicates that magical items are present, roll 1d100 on the Magical Items Main Table to find the type of magical item. The result indicates which subtable to roll on to find the exact nature of the magical treasure. Go to the appropriate subtable, roll on it as indicated, find which magical item is the treasure, and then skip to the text section on the appropriate magical item type to read the description. Note that a roll indicating a weapon can refer the DM to different methods of finding the actual weapon.

### Magical Item Subtables

Once the general type of magical item has been determined from the Magical Items Main Table, consult one of the corresponding sub-

tables below to find the exact nature of a magical item. There is a section of text for each type of magical treasure; these sections start after the weapon subtables. Generating some of these treasures can be complicated. If a suitable doesn't immediately make sense, read the text on the corresponding type of treasure.

Use the following guidelines when consulting the Magical Item Subtables:

1. Limitations: Several items are usable only by a certain character class, by all spellcasters, or by all nonspellcasters. If any of the following letters appear on the subtables, the item noted may only be used by the class specified.
   - (C): Cleric only.
   - (DR): Druid only.
   - (D): Dwarf only.
   - (E): Elf only.
   - (F): Fighter only.
   - (H): Halfling only.
   - (M): Magic-user only.
   - (N): Nonspellcaster only (fighters, thieves, dwarves, halflings, and mystics).
   - (S): Spellcaster only (clerics, druids, elves, and magic-users).
   - (T): Thief only.Note: In the subtables below, there are no magical items that only the mystic class can use, though such items—while against the mystic philosophy—are certainly possible.
2. Rejecting Results: The DM may, at any time, decide to reroll (or just choose) any treasure he or she has determined randomly. A magical item randomly rolled may simply be too powerful in a campaign and may make things too easy for characters. *Wishes*, for example can cause many problems, which may be prevented by simply not using items that grant *wishes* in the game or by strictly limiting their power. Generally, if the DM can foresee any game problems resulting from the introduction of an item or spell effect, avoid using the item.

## Magical Weapon Subtables

There are two methods for determining the actual magical weapon in a treasure. Because magical weapons can have a number of additional bonuses and abilities, determining the exact nature of a weapon is often complex.

The simplest method is a single table (the Magical Weapon Generation Table), recommended for generating weapons for characters who are levels 1-10; this table lists three types of weapons and basic magical bonuses. Simply choose the type of weapon to include in a treasure trove or roll randomly: 1-2, missile weapon or missile; 3-4, sword; or 5-6, miscellaneous weapon. Then roll 1d100 for the specific weapon.

The second method, following the Magical Weapon Generation Table, splits weapon generation into each type of weapon and is recommended for selecting magical weapons for characters of advanced levels. These subtables are also suitable if the DM would like a weapon to have more specific abilities and bonuses. This method presents three subtables that continue in the manner of the six previous subtables for magical items. There is a section of text for each type of magical weaponry; these sections are presented with the text explaining the previous magical items.

# Chapter 16: Treasure

## Potions

Some guidelines regarding potions are given in the following text.

**Appearance:** Potions are usually found in small glass vials. Each potion has a different smell and color—even two potions with the same effect appear completely different until used. A character sipping the potion (taking just a taste) will realize what the potion's effect is; the character can then label the potion and keep it for later use. Sipping a potion does not decrease the potion's effect or duration, although sipping a poisoned potion will cause the character to suffer the poison's effects.

**Level of Effect:** If the range of the potion's effect is not stated, treat it as if it were a spell cast by a 6th level spellcaster.

**Duration:** Unless stated otherwise, the effect of a potion lasts 7-12 turns. Roll 1d6 + 6 to determine the potion's duration. Only the DM should know the exact duration; he or she will roll for duration and keep track of it when a character uses a potion.

**Dosage:** Usually the entire contents of a vial is a single dose. The entire potion must be drunk for the potion to have the listed effect. If a potion does not follow this guideline, the text will inform the DM.

**In Combat:** Drinking a potion takes one round.

**Multiple Potions:** If a character drinks a potion while another potion is still in effect, that character will become sick and will be unable to do anything (no saving throw allowed) for three

turns (half an hour). Neither potion will have any further effect. Certain potions whose effects are permanent (for example, *healing* or *longevity*) do not count toward this restriction.

**Control Potions:** When using these potions, the user must see the victims to direct their actions. The controlled creatures cannot be forced to kill themselves. The character cannot perform any other actions while controlling others, and he may move at up to half normal speed only. A victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the control, but the user may repeat the attempt once per round, on any victim seen, until the potion's duration ends.

## Potion Descriptions

The potions listed in Magical Item Subtable: 1. Potions, page 229, are described in the following text.

**Agility:** The user's Dexterity score becomes 18, and the user immediately gains all applicable bonuses.

**Animal Control:** The user may control up to 3d6 Hit Dice of animals (normal or giant, but not fantastic or magical). When the control ends, the animals will be afraid and will leave the area if they can.

**Antidote:** The user becomes completely immune to certain poisons and gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. poison. The weakest type of antidote protects against the poison of all creatures with 3 Hit Dice or less; stronger antidotes counteract the poison of larger creatures. Poisons avoided during the duration of the potion (by

successful saving throws) have no effect after the duration ends.

Roll 1d10 to determine what types of poisons the *antidote* protects against.

1-4 Poisons from 3-HD (or lesser) creatures

5-7 Poisons from 7-HD (or lesser) creatures\*

8-9 Poisons from 15-HD (or lesser) creatures

10 All poisons

\* A *potion of poison* is normally treated as poison from a 7-HD monster. The DM can adjust this option as necessary.

**Blending:** The user may change color at will to any color, pattern, or combination of colors. Only color can be altered, but all items carried are affected. The user hidden by this chameleonlike camouflage can rarely be detected (10% chance) unless the observer can *detect invisible* things or possesses *true sight* (as the cleric spell) or a similar ability.

**Bug Repellent:** "Bug" includes any form of arachnid (spider, tick, scorpion, etc.), insect (ant, beetle, fly, etc.), or chilopod (centipede, millipede, etc.). After using this potion, the user cannot be touched by any normal bug, and a giant-sized bug will ignore the user unless the bug makes a saving throw vs. spells. If the saving throw is successful, the potion does not affect the giant bug. The potion adds a +4 bonus to any saving throws allowed against magically summoned or controlled bugs.

**Clairaudience:** The user may listen to noises (including speech) in an area up to 60' away through the ears of a creature in that area.

**Clairvoyance:** The user may see an area up to 60' away through the eyes of a creature in that area.

**Climbing:** The user may climb sheer surfaces as if a spider, with only a 5% chance of falling (checked per 100' of climbing, at least once per climb).

**Defense:** The user gains a bonus to armor class, which lasts for 1 turn only. Roll 1d10 to find the power of the potion.

| 1-3 | +1 |
|-----|----|
| 4-5 | +2 |
| 6-7 | +3 |
| 8-9 | +4 |
| 10  | +5 |

**Delusion:** The user will believe this potion to have the effect of any one other potion (roll again for the fake potion). However, it has no real effect.

**Diminution:** Anyone taking this potion will immediately shrink to 6" in height. He can only attack creatures smaller than 1' for normal damage. The user can slip through small cracks and has a 90% chance of not being seen when standing still. This potion will cancel a *potion of growth* without ill effects.

**Dragon Control:** There are several different types of this potion, one corresponding to each dragon type. The user may control up to three *small* dragons at once, but the dragons do get saving throws. Large and huge dragons are not affected by these potions. The controlled dragons will do whatever is commanded of them except cast spells. They will be hostile when the control ends. Roll 1d20 to find the type of dragons affected.

![Illustration showing a character in a robe, blindfolded, administering a potion to another character lying in a bed, possibly a dragon or monster.]()![](_page_231_Picture_33.jpeg)

| 1-5   | White (or Crystal) |
|-------|--------------------|
| 6-10  | Black (or Onyx)    |
| 11-14 | Green (or Jade)    |
| 15-17 | Blue (or Sapphire) |
| 18-19 | Red (or Ruby)      |
| 20    | Gold (or Amber)    |

The DM can roll 1d100 and on 01-30 the potion actually affects the gemstone dragon equivalent (crystal instead of white, onyx instead of black, etc.).

Dreamspeech: If the user speaks to one sleeping or paralyzed creature within 30', the creature will hear and silently answer as if awake. The user will hear the responses by ESP and will be able to understand the language used. The creature is not compelled to be truthful. Dead and undead creatures cannot be affected, but *cursed* sleeping victims are within the power of the potion. The effect lasts for 1 turn only, and it applies to only one sleeping or paralyzed creature.

Elasticity: The user may stretch his or her body, plus all equipment carried, to nearly any form—flat, long, etc.—to a maximum of 30' long or a minimum of 1' thick. Items carried cannot be used or dropped unless they are first returned to normal form. While in "stretched" form, the user cannot attack or cast spells, but he takes half damage from blunt weapons (mace, hammer, giant-thrown boulder, etc.). The effect lasts for 1 turn only.

Elemental Form: There are four types of this potion: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water (equal chances for each). The user may change into the form of an elemental (of the appropriate type) and back to normal form as often as desired while the potion lasts. Each change of form takes 1 round. While in elemental form, no special immunities are gained, but the special attacks of each elemental are usable (see Chapter 14). Note that a *protection from evil* effect will not block a character using this potion. The user's armor class and hit points do not change. The duration is 1 turn only.

ESP: This potion will have the same effect as the magic-user spell *ESP*. The user can "hear" the thoughts (if any) of any one creature within 60' by concentrating for one full round in one direction. The user can "hear" through 2' of rock, but a thin coating of lead will block the ESP.

Etherality: The user can become eternal once, at any time during the potion's duration, and may thereafter remain eternal for up to 24 hours, returning to the Prime Plane at will. Once he has returned to the Prime Plane, the potion will not enable him to become ethereal again.

Fire Resistance: The user cannot be harmed by normal fire, and he gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws against fire attacks. In addition, the user takes less damage from magical and dragon fire: -1 point per die of damage (minimum of 1 point per die).

Flying: The user may fly at up to 120' per round without tiring (as the effects of the magic-user spell).

Fortitude: The user's Constitution score becomes 18, and the user immediately gains corresponding hit points (if any). Points of damage to the user are taken from the magically gained hit points *first*. Damage applied to the user's original hit points will remain after the duration ends until cured by the usual means.

Freedom: The user cannot be affected by paralysis of any sort nor by *hold person* or *hold monster* spells.

Gaseous Form: Upon drinking this potion, the user's body will take the form of a cloud of gas. Anything the user is carrying or wearing will fall through the gaseous body to land on the floor. The user will keep control over his body, and he can move through small holes in walls, chests, and so forth. A creature or character in gaseous form cannot attack, but he has an AC of —2 and cannot be harmed by nonmagical weapons.

Giant Control: There are several different types of this potion, one for each type of giant. The user may control up to four giants at once, but each giant gets a saving throw. They will be hostile once the control ends. Roll 1d20 to find the type of giant affected.

| 1-5   | Hill     |
|-------|----------|
| 6-10  | Stone    |
| 11-14 | Frost    |
| 15-16 | Fire     |
| 17    | Mountain |
| 18    | Sea      |
| 19    | Cloud    |
| 20    | Storm    |

Giant Strength: The user gains the strength of a frost giant. However, the potion has no effect if a strength-adjusting magical item (such as *gauntlet of ogre power*) is worn. Otherwise, the user inflicts double normal damage with any weapon, and he may throw small boulders (ranges 60/130/200) for 3d6 points of damage.

Growth: This potion causes the user to grow twice normal size, temporarily increasing effective Strength, giving the ability to inflict *double damage* (twice the amount rolled) on any successful hit. The user's hit points, however, will not increase. This potion will cancel a *potion of diminution* without ill effects.

Healing: Like the clerical cure *light wounds* spell, drinking this potion will restore 1d6 + 1 (2-7) lost hit points or will cure *paralysis* for one creature.

Heroism: This potion has no effect on an elf, a cleric, magic-user, mystic, or thief. However, a fighter, dwarf, halfing, or normal man (or monster!) who drinks this potion gains the Hit Dice, hit points, and all abilities of a higher level character (or monster) as follows.

| Current Level | Effect                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Normal man    | Becomes a 4th level fighter |
| 1-3           | Gains 3 levels or Hit Dice  |
| 4-7           | Gains 2 levels or Hit Dice  |
| 8-10          | Gains 1 level or Hit Die    |
| 11+           | No effect                   |

All wounds taken during the duration of the potion—including energy drains—are subtracted from the magically gained hit points and levels first.

Human Control: The user may control up to 6 Hit Dice of humans at once (normal men counting as 1/2 Hit Die each), similar to the effects of a *charm person* spell. The effect has a 60' range, and the *charm* lasts only as long as the potion's duration.

Invisibility: This potion will have the same effects as the magic-user spell *invisibility*. The potion will make the user invisible. When a

character becomes invisible, all the items (but not other creatures) carried and worn by the user also become invisible. Any invisible item will become visible again when it leaves the character's possession (set down, dropped, and so forth). The DM may allow players to divide a single potion of *invisibility* into as many as six sips, each of which works normally but lasts only one turn.

Invulnerability: The user's armor class and saving throws gain a bonus of 2 for the duration of the potion. If used more than once per week, the only effect is sickness.

Levitation: Drinking this potion will have the same effects as the magic-user spell *levitation*. The user may move up or down in the air without any support. This potion does not enable the user to move side-to-side. The user could, however, levitate to a ceiling and move sideways by pushing or pulling. Motion up or down is at a rate of 60' per round.

Longevity: The user immediately becomes 10 years younger. The effect is permanent, does not wear off, and cannot be dispelled. This potion will have no effect on any creature *forced* to drink it. In addition, age cannot be reduced below 15 (or below midadolecence for creatures other than humans), and the change cannot adversely affect any ability scores or other abilities.

Luck: This potion makes the user lucky. The *player* of the character using this potion may *choose* the result of any one roll of his rather than rolling a random result (an attack or damage roll, saving throw, etc.). Other players' rolls cannot be affected, nor can the Dungeon Master's rolls be affected. The effect lasts for 1 hour or until the luck is used.

Merging: The effect of this potion is quite unusual. The user can permit others to actually merge their forms with the user's, including all equipment carried, as if all were gaseous. A maximum of seven other creatures can *merge* with the user of the potion. The merging cannot be forced; the user can, at will, prevent anyone from merging. A creature merged with the user can leave the merger by merely stepping out. No creature merged with another (including the user) can attack or cast a spell, but he may speak. Damage to the user of the potion does not affect those *merged*.

Plant Control: The user may control all plants and plantlike creatures (including monsters) in a 30' x 30' area up to 60' away. Normal plants controlled may entangle victims in their area, but they cannot cause damage.

Poison: Poisons look like normal magical potions. A character who swallows any amount of this potion, even a sip, must make a saving throw vs. poison or die! The DM can choose to have the poison do a specific amount of damage instead as another option.

Polymorph Self: The user may change shape (as the magic-user spell) up to once per round until the potion wears off.

Sight: The user can *detect invisible* things (as the magic-user spell) for 1 turn. This will negate blindness for that time.

Speech: The user can understand any and all languages heard within 60' and can respond in the same tongues. A language must be heard to be used unless already known.

Speed: The user moves twice as fast, can attack twice per round, and performs other actions ex-

# Chapter 16: Treasure

cept spellcasting at twice normal speed.

Strength: The user's Strength score becomes 18, and the user immediately gains all applicable bonuses.

Super-Healing: This potion acts just like an application of a cleric's *curse critical wounds* spell (see Chapter 3 for details of this spell).

Swimming: The user may swim in any liquid at the rate of 180' per turn, even if encumbered. The user cannot sink (or even be pushed below the surface) unless the encumbrance is over 3,000 en. The ability to breathe water is *not* granted by this potion. The effects last for 8 hours.

Treasure Finding: By concentrating, the user can detect the direction and distance (but not the amount) of the largest treasure within 360°.

Undead Control: The user may control up to 18 Hit Dice of undead monsters. The undead will be hostile when the control ends.

Water Breathing: The user can freely breathe either water or air (as the magic-user spell) for 4 hours.

## Scrolls

A scroll is a piece of old paper or parchment upon which a high-level magic-user, elf, or cleric has written a magical formula. It is also possible to generate maps via scrolls as noted on the Magical Item Subtable: 2. Scrolls; these maps are cartographic diagrams of a particular area (often one where treasure is hidden or lost cities are to be found).

Some guidelines regarding scrolls are given in the following text.

Who Can Use: Only magic-users, elves, and 10th level (or higher-level) thieves can use magical scrolls; only clerics and druids can use clerical scrolls; and only druids can use druidic scrolls.

Determining Contents: To determine what's on a scroll, characters must have enough light to read by. Magic-users and elves must use a *read magic* spell to determine what's on a scroll; thieves, clerics, and druids simply read their scrolls. In any case, all characters must not read the scroll aloud unless they also wish to cast the spell at the same time as they figure out the kind of spell.

Casting the Scroll Spell: To cast the spell on a scroll, the character must be able to read the scroll and must read it aloud. A scroll may only be used once; the words disappear as they are read aloud.

Protection Spells: Anyone who can read—not just spellcasters—may use protection scrolls; the protection spell disappears as it is read aloud.

Treasure Maps: Anyone who can read—not just spellcasters—may understand treasure maps; a character who cannot read may make an Intelligence check to understand the map anyway. Such maps do not disappear when read.

## Scroll Descriptions

The scrolls listed in Magical Item Subtable: 2. Scrolls, page 229, are described in the following text.

Communication: This is actually two scrolls, one stored inside the other. They are easily separated. If a message is written on one scroll, it im-

mediately appears on the other. There is no limit to the range, as long as both scrolls are on the same plane of existence. The message may be up to 100 words in length. If one message is erased, the other disappears as well. Each message must be erased before another can be written, and there is a 5% chance (not cumulative) that any erasing will destroy the magic of both scrolls.

Creation: The user of this valuable scroll may draw a picture of any normal item up to 5' x 10' x 1' in size (though drawn much smaller) and up to 5,000 en weight. The item may then be taken off the scroll and used! Magical items cannot be created nor can any living things, but all types of armor and weapons, for example, are quite easily created. The item will vanish either on command of the creator or after 24 hours. The scroll can create one item per day only.

Cursed: Unfortunately, when any writing on a cursed scroll is even seen, the victim is immediately *cursed*. No reading is necessary! The DM must make up each scroll's curse. Examples of a few common curses include the following:

- The reader turns into a frog (or some other harmless animal).
- A wandering monster of the same level as the reader appears and attacks the reader by surprise (a free attack with bonuses).
- One magical item owned by the reader disappears (the item is chosen or randomly determined by the DM).
- The reader loses one level of experience, as if struck by a wight. (The DM should roll again for a first-level character to avoid unfair "instant death").
- The reader's Prime Requisite must be re-rolled.
- Future wounds will take twice as long to heal, and healing spells will only restore half normal amounts until the curse is lifted.

Only a *remove curse* spell (see Chapter 3) can remove a curse of this nature. However, the DM may allow the cursed character to be cured by a high-level NPC cleric or magic-user, who will demand that the character complete a special adventure or perform a worthy but difficult task.

Delay: This is a scroll of one spell. When casting the spell from the scroll, the user states an amount of delay from 0 to 12 rounds. Thereafter, if the user carries the scroll, the user has complete control of the spell when it occurs. If the scroll is not carried by the user, the spell effect appears around the scroll itself, affecting the nearest creature if a recipient is part of the spell process. *The spell does not affect the scroll, even if it is a fire-type spell.* For example, an elf reads a *delay lightning bolt* scroll, delaying it 8 rounds, and then puts the scroll away. Eight rounds later, when the *lightning bolt* actually appears, the elf may choose the range and direction by mere concentration, as if casting the spell at that time.

Equipment: This parchment is inscribed with the names of six normal items (which the DM selects or randomly determines, using the Adventuring Gear Table from Chapter 4). When any item's name is read aloud, the item appears within 10' of the scroll; the name disappears. The item will remain for 24 hours or until the user commands it to vanish. The name reappears on the scroll when the item vanishes. Any three of the six items listed on the scroll can be created

![Illustration of two pirates examining treasure on a map or scroll.]()![](_page_233_Picture_26.jpeg)

each day.

**Illumination:** This scroll bears the drawing of a flame. If the scroll is set afire, it will burn with a clear light in a 60' radius, lasting for up to 6 hours per day. The burning does not harm the scroll, but it is nevertheless "normal" fire (and can be used to light torches, for example). The flame cannot be extinguished except by water or on command of the user; no wind, normal or magical, can cause it to even flicker. This item may already be lit when found.

**Mages (spellcasters only):** This scroll is blank; it is used to identify magical effects. The user may hold the scroll and command it to identify any one chosen magical effect within 30'. The name of the magical spell or effect then appears on the scroll, along with the level of the caster of the spell effect. The scroll will identify one magical effect per day.

**Maps to Treasures (Normal, Magical, Combined, or Special):** Each map should be made in advance by the DM. Such maps show a route to the location of a treasure in a dungeon or a wilderness area. The treasure is usually hidden or protected by monsters, traps, and/or magic. Based on the type of treasure given, the DM should select a challenging monster (who has a similar treasure type) and design the map and monster lair accordingly. Note that the map may be partially incorrect, omitting an important detail (such as the type of monsters, dangerous traps, etc.) or giving some false information; however, the treasure mentioned should actually be there. Sometimes maps are only partially complete or are written in the form of a riddle. And some can only be read by a *read languages* spell.

**Normal treasure** contains coins and gems but no magical items, while a *magical treasure* may include some coins and a few gems of low value in addition to magical items. A *combined treasure* has coins, magical items, and valuable gems or jewelry in roughly equal proportions. *Special treasure* should contain at least one permanent magical item, such as a staff or sword; these items should be mentioned on the map.

**Mapping:** This scroll is blank. When held and commanded to write, this scroll will draw a map of an area chosen (that is, the DM accurately draws the map for the players). The area must be completely within 100' of the scroll, and it may be up to 10,000 square feet in size. The scroll has 1 chance in 6 to detect secret doors, but it will not draw what lies beyond them. The scroll functions once per day.

**Portals:** This scroll creates a *pass-wall* effect, identical to the magic-user spell. When placed on a surface and commanded to function, the scroll disappears and a 5'-diameter hole appears that is up to 10' deep. The scroll does not affect living or magical things. The hole will disappear after 3 turns or when commanded by the reader of the scroll. When the hole disappears, the scroll reappears. The scroll may be used twice each day.

**Protection:** A protection scroll may be read and used by any character who can read the Common language. When read, it creates a circle of protection 10' across that will move with the reader at its center. It will prevent any of the given creatures from entering this circle, but it does not prevent spell or missile attacks from those creatures. The circle will be broken if any-

one protected attacks one of the given creatures in hand-to-hand combat.

**Four types of protection scrolls** are described in the following text.

**Protection from Elementals:** This scroll creates a circle of protection (10' radius) around the reader. No elemental can attack those within the circle unless attacked first in hand-to-hand combat. Once attacked, an elemental may attack in return. The effect lasts for 2 turns and moves with the reader.

**Protection from Lycanthropes:** When read, this scroll will protect all those within the circle for 6 turns against a variable number of lycanthropes. The number of lycanthropes affected varies according to their type, as follows.

| Werebats, wererats, werefoxes | 1d10 affected |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Wereboars, werewolves         | 1d8 affected  |
| Wereseals, weresharks         | 1d6 affected  |
| Werebears, weretigers         | 1d4 affected  |
| Devil swine                   | 1d2 affected  |

**Protection from Magic:** This scroll creates a circle of protection (10' radius) around the reader. No spells or spell effects (including those from items) may enter or leave the circle. The effect lasts for 1d4 turns, moves with the reader, and may not be broken except by a *wish*.

**Protection from Undead:** When read, this scroll will protect all those within the circle from a variable number of undead for 6 turns. The number of undead affected varies according to their type, as follows.

| Skeletons, zombies, ghouls    | 2d12 affected |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Wights, wraiths, mummies      | 2d6 affected  |
| Specters (or larger monsters) | 1d6 affected  |

**Questioning:** The user of this scroll may ask questions of any nonliving nonmagical objects; their answers will appear on the scroll. The scroll will display up to three answers per day. The answers will be given as if the objects were living beings, but they will be limited to simple observations as if the objects could see, hear, and smell. The scroll cannot be used to question living or magical things.

**Repetition:** This scroll appears to be a normal scroll of one spell, and the standard restrictions apply to its use. However, 1 turn after the spell is cast, the scroll creates the same spell effect a second time, centered on the scroll or affecting the nearest creature if a recipient is part of the spell process. As with a normal spell scroll, any spell cast from it is then gone; however, another spell may be written on the scroll *if it is of the same level*, and the *repetition* effect will again apply.

**Seeing:** This scroll is blank. When held and commanded to write, it will draw pictures of creatures within 100' in any area chosen by the user. Up to four different types of creatures can be pictured. The scroll will function once per day, regardless of the number of creatures pictured.

**Shelter:** This scroll is inscribed with an elaborate drawing of a 10'-square room, lit, with two beds, a table and two chairs, food and drink for two on the table, and a pair of normal swords on the far wall, each hung over a shield. If the scroll is hung on any vertical surface, the room pictured may be entered and the items used. The food and drink are pure and will nourish any living thing. The swords and shields may be taken

down and used. However, none of the items can be removed from the room.

If the scroll is taken down, the room cannot be entered or left, but remains in existence on another dimension. If any creatures are in the room when the scroll is taken down, the air inside permits survival for up to 24 hours. No creatures so caught can escape by any means other than a *wish*. The food and drink are replenished each time the scroll is taken down. The room can be created once per day and will remain for up to 12 hours per use; if not removed in that time, the scroll will fall down by itself.

**Spell Catching:** This scroll is blank when found. It may be used to "catch" a spell cast at the user. It cannot catch spell-like effects, nor can it catch device-produced effects (such as from a wand), but a spell cast from a scroll *can* be caught. There are four types of this scroll; roll 1d10 to determine the capacity.

| 1-4 | 1st or 2nd level spells |
|-----|-------------------------|
| 5-7 | 1st to 4th level spells |
| 8-9 | 1st to 6th level spells |
| 10  | 1st to 8th level spells |

The user of the scroll must hold it up, like a shield; no other action is possible while using the scroll. The user must then make a saving throw vs. spells, with a +4 bonus to the roll; if successful, the incoming spell has no effect and is instead transferred to the scroll, appearing as a normal scroll spell. The exact spell caught will not be known until a *read magic* spell is used to identify it.

The scroll can only hold one spell at a time; the spell caught must either be used or copied into a spell book (magic-user spells only) before the scroll can catch another spell. Any type of spell (magical, clerical, or druidic) can be caught as long as the level does not exceed the scroll's capacity. The *scroll ofspell catching* cannot affect spells of levels greater than the given capacity, and it can catch a maximum of one spell per day.

**Spells:** Use Spell Scrolls in the magical item suitable for scrolls to find the exact spell levels or choose spells as appropriate. Spell scrolls are good ways to introduce new spells in a campaign, and they may thus be designed with the characters' current spell books in mind. Note that only druids can cast spells on druid scrolls, though the spell name can be revealed by a *read magic* spell.

**Trapping:** This scroll can create one trap. The type of trap differs by the placement of the scroll. The scroll is destroyed when the trap is created. If placed on a floor, a hidden pit trap is created; if on a ceiling, a falling block trap appears. On walls, a poison dart or gas trap will be created. The exact trap is left for the DM's design. The trap created is quite real and is not illusory or magical.

**Truth:** This scroll is blank when found. The user may ask a question of any living being within 30'; the complete and true answer appears on the scroll, read from the victim's mind by a powerful version of *ESP*. Note that the answer is true only within the limits of the victim's knowledge. The scroll will display one answer per day.

## Wands, Staves, and Rods

A *wand* is a thin, smooth stick about 18" long; a *staff* is 2" thick and about 6' long; and a *rod* is similar to a wand, but is 3' long. A wand can only be used by a magic-user or an elf. A staff can only be used by a spellcaster (sometimes restricted to a specific type). Lastly, a rod may be used by any character class.

A wand normally has 2d10 charges when found and a staff 3d10; the DM rolls the number, keeps the result to himself, and tracks the character's use of the wand or staff. If desired, the DM may use a larger number of charges: 3d10 for a wand, 2d20 for a staff. Rods are permanent items that do not require charges. Each use of a power costs one charge unless noted otherwise. Each item may be used once per round at most.

### Wand Descriptions

The wands listed in Magical Item Subtable: 3. Wands, Staves, and Rods, page 229, are described in the following text. Note that all of the wands listed here are usable only by magic-users.

**Wand of Cold:** This wand creates a cone of cold, 60' long and 30' wide at the far end. All within the cone take 6d6 points of cold damage, but they may make a saving throw vs. wands for half damage.

**Wand of Enemy Detection:** When a charge is used, this item will cause all enemies within 60' (even those hidden or invisible) to glow, as if on fire.

**Wand of Fear:** This wand creates a cone of fear, 60' long and 30' wide at the far end. All within the cone must make a saving throw vs. wands or run away from the user at three times their normal rate for 30 rounds.

**Wand of Fireballs:** This creates a *fireball* effect (as if using the magic-user spell) up to 240' away. All victims take 6d6 points of fire damage, but they may make a saving throw vs. wands for half damage.

**Wand of Illusion:** This creates a *phantasmal* force effect (as if using the magic-user spell). The user must concentrate on the illusion to maintain it, but he may walk at half normal movement rate while doing so.

**Wand of Lightning Bolts:** This creates a *lightning bolt* (as if using the magic-user spell), starting up to 240' away and 60' long from that point. The victims take 6d6 points of electrical damage, but they may make a saving throw vs. wands for half damage.

**Wand of Magic Detection:** When a charge is used, this item will cause any magical item within 20' to glow. If the item cannot normally be seen (within a closed chest, for example), the glow will not be seen.

**Wand of Metal Detection:** This wand will point toward any type of metal named if within 20' and if 1,000 cn or more in weight. The user cannot detect the amount of metal.

**Wand of Negation:** This wand can be used to cancel the effects of one other wand or staff. If the other effect has a duration, the negation lasts for one round.

**Wand of Paralyzation:** This wand projects a cone-shaped ray when a charge is used. The ray is 60' long and 30' wide at its end. Any creature

struck by the ray must make a saving throw vs. wands or be paralyzed for 6 turns.

**Wand of Polymorphing:** This wand creates either a *polymorph self* or *polymorph other* effect (as if using the magic-user spells). The user must state which effect is desired. An unwilling victim may make a saving throw vs. wands to avoid the effect.

**Wand of Secret Door Detection:** The user may find any secret door within 20', using one charge per secret door found.

**Wand of Trap Detection:** This wand will point at all traps within 20', one at a time, at a cost of one charge per trap found.

### Staff Descriptions

The staves listed in Magical Item Subtable: 3. Wands, Staves, and Rods, page 229, are described in the following text.

**Staff of Commanding:** Usable by all spellcasters, this magical item has all the powers of the rings of animal, human, and plant control (see the individual descriptions under "Rings," below).

**Staff of Dispelling:** The touch of this item has the same effect as a *dispel magic* spell from a 15th level caster, but it will affect only the item or magical effect touched. Any potion or scroll touched is completely destroyed, and any permanent magical item touched becomes non-magical for 1d4 rounds (including armor and weapons). This effect may be permanently harmful to intelligent swords (DM's choice). Each use of the staff costs one charge. This staff is usable by any character.

**Staff of the Druids:** This staff is usable only by druids. A druid carrying this staff gains one extra spell of each spell level. The extra spells must be selected when the usual spells are acquired (usually during morning meditation). Each day's use of the staff uses one charge. The staff is a +3 weapon as well, and it may be used as such (inflicting 1d6 + 3 points of damage per hit) without using any charges.

**Staff of an Element:** Usable only by magic-users, there are seven types of these staves; roll 1d100 to determine the exact type found.

| 01-21 | Staff of Air             |
|-------|--------------------------|
| 22-42 | Staff of Earth           |
| 43-63 | Staff of Fire            |
| 64-84 | Staff of Water           |
| 85-91 | Staff of Air and Water   |
| 92-98 | Staff of Earth and Fire  |
| 99-00 | Staff of Elemental Power |

Each staff is a *staff* +2 and may be used as one without using any charges, striking for 1d6 + 2 points of damage. Staves of two elements gain all the powers of both staves, and the *staff of elemental power* has the powers of all four.

Each staff contains the following powers when used on the Prime Plane:

- A +4 bonus to saving throws vs. attack forms based on that element.
- Complete immunity to attacks by any elemental of that type.
- The ability to summon one 8-Hit Dice elemental of that type per day (as the magic-user spell), each summoning costing one charge.
- Certain spell-like effects, each costing one

charge per use. These created spell effects are treated as if cast by a 10th level spellcaster. The effects are dependent on type of element as follows:

**Air:** *lightning bolt*, *cloudkill*  
**Earth:** *web*, *wall of stone*  
**Fire:** *fireball*, *wall of fire*  
**Water:** *ice* (storm or wall)

When used on the elemental plane of the corresponding type, the powers are quite different. As long as one or more charges remain in the staff, the powers granted to the holder are not the powers given above, but are rather the following powers:

- Immunity to damage from the plane itself, with vision to 60' range.
- Movement within the plane at the rate of 120 feet per turn (40/round).
- Communication ability with any resident of that plane.
- A -4 bonus to armor class if attacked by a resident of that plane.

Note that these staves do not provide the ability to breathe on the plane; some other device or spell must also be used. However, when a staff is used along with a matching *ring of elemental adaptation* or *talisman of elemental travel*, all effects given above are extended to a 10' radius around the user.

Except for the *staff of elemental power*, each staff can be used to negate effects relating to the element to which it is opposed (see the Dominance-Opposition Table on page 264), at the cost of one charge if the effect was produced by the opposite staff or two charges if a normal spell was used. For example, a *staff of air* could be used to negate a *wall of fire* spell cast by any magic-user, at the cost of two charges.

A summoned elemental may be sent back to its home plane with the same cost of charges (one if produced by the opposite staff, two if conjured by spell), but the elemental must be touched by the staff (possibly requiring a normal attack roll).

If a staff is ever taken to the plane it is opposed to, it immediately explodes, inflicting 20 points of electrical damage plus 1d8 points of damage per charge remaining in the staff. The explosion fills a sphere of 60' radius; all creatures within the effect may make a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty to the roll to take half damage. The wielder of the staff, however, gets no saving throw.

**Staff of Harming:** Usable only by clerics, this item functions similarly to a reversed *staff of healing*, at the cost of one charge per creature harmed. It inflicts 1d6 + 1 (2-7) points of damage to any creature touched by the staff (no saving throw); a normal attack roll may be required. This is in addition to normal weapon damage (1d6 points), if applicable.

The *staff of harming* can also create the following effects, with the costs noted. Each effect is identical to the reversed form of a clerical spell. Note that the use of this staff is a Chaotic act.

| <i>Cause blindness</i>      | 2 charges |
|-----------------------------|-----------|
| <i>Cause disease</i>        | 2 charges |
| <i>Cause serious wounds</i> | 3 charges |
| <i>Create poison</i>        | 4 charges |

**Staff of Healing:** Usable only by clerics, this staff will heal 1d6 + 1 (2-7) points of damage per

use. It may only be used once per day per person, but it will heal any number of persons once a day. It does not have or use charges for healing.

As an option, the DM may add charges to the staff (in addition to its curing abilities) to create the following effects, at the cost of the charges indicated.

| Cure blindness      | 1 charge  |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Cure disease        | 1 charge  |
| Cure serious wounds | 2 charges |
| Neutralize poison   | 2 charges |

Staff of Power: This item can be used as a *staff of striking* and can also be used to create any of the following magic-user spell effects (each doing 8d6 points of damage): *fireball, lightning bolt, and ice storm*. It can also create a *continual light effect* or move 2,400 cm of weight by *telekinesis*, as the ring. This staff is usable only by magic-users.

Snake Staff: Usable only by clerics, this magical staff is a *staff +1* and will inflict *ld6 +1* points of damage per hit.

Upon command, the staff turns into a snake and coils around the creature struck. The command may be spoken when the victim is hit. The victim is allowed to make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the serpent's coil. Any man-sized or smaller victim will be held helpless for 1d4 turns (unless the snake is ordered by the owner to release the victim before that time). Larger creatures cannot be ensnared in the snake's coils. The snake's characteristics are as follows.

Snake: AC 5; HD 3; hp 20; MV 60' (20'); #AT 1 (special); Dmg Nil (special); Save C3; ML 12; XP 6

When freed, the snake crawls back to its owner and becomes a staff once again. The snake is completely healed when it returns to staff form. If killed in snake form, it cannot return to staff form and it loses all magical properties. This item does not have or use charges.

At the DM's option, the staff can be given charges. The user can spend charges to add bonuses to the snake's attack foil (+1 bonus per charge spent); up to five charges can be used in a single attack (for a +5 bonus).

A charge can also be used to cure the snake while it is in combat. The user casts a curing spell of any type and expends one charge to transfer the cure to the snake. The amount of curing is determined normally; no range limit applies.

Staff of Striking: Usable by all spellcasters, this weapon inflicts 2d6 (2-12) points of damage per charge if the hit is successful. Only one charge may be used per strike.

Staff of Withering: One hit from this staff ages the victim 10 years. One or two hits will be fatal to most animals and harmful to many humans. Elves may ignore the first 200 years of aging, dwarves may ignore the first 50 years, and halflings may ignore the first 20 years. Undead are not affected by this item. This staff is usable only by clerics.

Staff of Wizardry: Usable only by magic-users, this *staff +1* has all the powers of a *staff of power*, plus the magic-user spell effects of *invisibility, passwall, web, and conjure elemental*. It may also be used to create a whirlwind (as if from a djinni) or shoot a cone of paralyzation (as the

wand). In addition, the user may break the staff, which releases all of its power at once. This *final strike* is an explosion that inflicts 8 points of damage per charge remaining in the staff. All creatures within 30' (including the user!) take damage (but all may make a saving throw vs. staff for half damage).

## Rod Descriptions

The rods listed in Magical Item Subtable: 3. Wands, Staves, and Rods, page 229, are described in the following text.

Rod of Cancellation: This rod is usable by any character. It will work only once, but it will drain any magical item it hits, making that item forever nonmagical. The target is treated as having an armor class of 9. The DM may adjust the armor class of an item if it is being used in combat (such as when trying to hit a sword).

Intelligent magical swords and +5 magical items may resist the effect of the rod if the user makes a saving throw vs. wands. This merely indicates successful resistance, and the rod still retains its power. A *sword +5* with intelligence, for example, gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw.

Rod of Dominion: Usable by any character, this rod aids in ruling. If a ruler carries it on a tour throughout his or her dominion, the rod adds a bonus to all Confidence Level rolls, based on the percentage of residents viewing it (roll 1d100 for the result).

| 01-50 | +10 |
|-------|-----|
| 51-75 | +20 |
| 76-90 | +30 |
| 91-99 | +40 |
| 00    | +50 |

When not on display, the rod must be kept in the ruler's stronghold. The effects last for three months, but the rod may be shown again to the populace as desired.

Rod of Health: Usable by clerics only, this rod has all the powers of a *staff of healing*, but without expending any charges. It can affect any one creature only once per day, regardless of the effect chosen.

Rod of Inertia: Only a dwarf, halfling, fighter, thief, or mystic may use this unusual item. It may be used as a *spear +3* in all respects. On command of the user, it will stop wherever it is, and it cannot be moved by any means except a *wish*. A second command releases it. If the rod is in motion when stopped, it will continue its direction when released. For example, it may be thrown toward a door and commanded to stop, later released if an enemy enters so that the rod will continue toward the enemy (a normal attack roll is made). If the user falls, a command will stop the rod suddenly, and the user may hold onto the rod.

Rod of Parrying: This *rod +5* can be used as a melee weapon, inflicting 1d8 + 5 (6-13) points of damage per hit (but no Strength bonus applies). It may also be used to parry attacks, if the user chooses this ability at the beginning of a round.

When *attacked* in melee, the user's armor class gains a +5 bonus while parrying; however, this does not apply to avoiding missile fire. While using the *rod of parrying*, no other action is possible except a Fighting Withdrawal maneuver (see Chapter 8). This rod is usable by any character.

Rod of Victory: Usable by any character, this rod makes the user lucky in war (when the War Machine mass combat system is used). The following bonuses apply to that system:

- A +25 bonus applies to the Combat Results roll (to a maximum total of 100).
- On the Combat Results Table, if the difference in overall totals is 101 or more, the result for "91-100" is used, limiting the number of casualties.

Rod of Weaponry: This *rod +5* is only usable by a dwarf, halfling, fighter, thief, or mystic. On command of the user, it will elongate and may be divided into two weapons of the same size, each +2. Each of those may be similarly divided into two +1 weapons. The rod cannot be divided accidentally, and it can be reassembled simply by placing the parts together. Each weapon, regardless of size, inflicts 1d6 points of damage per hit, plus magic bonuses (but not Strength bonuses).

Rod of the Wym: Usable by any character, there are three types of this rod; determine the type randomly or select one.

| Id10 | Alignment | Dragon | AC | Breath (s) |
|------|-----------|--------|----|------------|
| 1-5  | Lawful    | Gold   | -2 | Fire/Gas   |
| 6-8  | Neutral   | Blue   | 0  | Lightning  |
| 9-10 | Chaotic   | Black  | 2  | Acid       |

Each is a *rod +5* and each inflicts 1d8 + 5 (6-13) points of damage per hit (but without Strength bonuses). Once per day, the rod may be turned into a small dragon of the appropriate type. The created dragon has 30 hit points and can only be affected by magic (weapons, spells, etc.). It will understand and faithfully serve the user of the rod to the best of its ability; for example, it can act as messenger, steed, or guard. It will fight to the death unless commanded otherwise. The dragon knows no spells. It will return to rod form on command; if slain in dragon form, however, it cannot return to rod form and is forever destroyed. Spells and other magical forms of healing can be used to heal the creature, if desired, but not after it is killed.

If a dragon is created by a user of a different alignment, the dragon will attack the user immediately, fighting to the death. When this occurs, it cannot be commanded to return to rod form.

## Rings

A magical ring *must* be worn on a finger or thumb to function. However, a ring may also be carried and then put on when needed. Only one magical ring can be worn per hand. If more than that are worn, the rings negate each other and none will function, with the exception of a *ring of weakness*.

Any ring may be used by any character class, except where noted otherwise in the text.

## Ring Descriptions

The rings listed in Magical Item Subtable: 4. Rings, page 229, are described in the following text.

Animal Control: The wearer of this ring may command 1d6 normal animals (or one giant-sized). The animals are not allowed a saving throw to resist control. The ring will not control intelligent animal species or fantastic or magical

monsters. The wearer must be able to see the animals to control them. The control will last as long as the wearer concentrates on the animals and does not move or fight. When the wearer stops concentrating, the animals will be free to attack their controller or run away (roll reactions with a penalty of —1 to the roll). This ring can only be used once per turn.

**Delusion:** The wearer will believe this to be any one other ring (roll again for the imaginary type). However, it has no real effect. The wearer will not be convinced otherwise until a *remove curse* is used to dispel the enchantment.

**Djinni Summoning:** The wearer may summon one djinni to serve for up to one day. The djinni will only serve and obey the person wearing the ring at the time of its summoning. The ring may be used only once per week.

**Ear:** This ring, worn on the ear as an earring, has no effect when worn. However, when removed and placed against any surface (a door, chest, etc.), the user may hear all noises occurring within 60' of the surface. Light breathing, heartbeats, and even faint breezes can be heard. The ring will function three times per day.

**Elemental Adaptation:** There are seven different types of this ring; roll 1d100 to determine the exact type or select one as appropriate.

| 01-21 | Air            |
|-------|----------------|
| 22-42 | Earth          |
| 43-63 | Fire           |
| 64-84 | Water          |
| 85-91 | Air and Water  |
| 92-98 | Earth and Fire |
| 99-00 | All elements   |

The wearer of this ring can, when in the appropriate elemental plane, freely breathe and see through the gaseous element (the equivalent of air on the Prime Plane).

**Fire Resistance:** The wearer of this ring will not be harmed by normal fires, and he gains a bonus of +2 on all saving throws vs. fire spells and vs. red dragon breath. In addition, the DM subtracts 1 point from each die of fire damage to the wearer (with a minimum damage of 1 point per die rolled to determine the damage).

**Holiness:** This ring is usable only by a cleric or druid. If the ring is worn while spells are gained (usually during morning meditation), the cleric gains one extra spell each of levels 1, 2, and 3 as appropriate. (Extra spells apply only to spell levels obtainable. For example, a 5th level cleric would not gain any 3rd level spells.) If the ring is removed, the spells are forgotten (though this has no effect if the spells are already cast). In addition, a cleric (but not a druid) gains a +1 bonus to any rolls to turn undead, including the roll determining the Hit Dice of undead turned. The ring does not affect turn attempts not requiring a roll.

**Human Control:** This is the same effect as the potion of the same name. The effect lasts until canceled by the wearer of the ring, the ring is removed, or until a *dispel magic* spell removes the charm.

**Invisibility:** The wearer is invisible as long as the ring is worn. If the wearer attacks or casts spells, he or she will become visible. The wearer can only become invisible once per turn, but there is no duration to the invisibility; the wearer will stay invisible as long as he does not take off

the ring, attack someone, or cast spells.

**Life Protection:** This valuable ring will negate the effects of  $ext{ld6}$  energy drain attacks. If the wearer is struck by an energy-draining undead (or effect), charges are drained from the ring and no levels are lost. If a single blow drains more experience levels than there are charges remaining in the ring, the ring disintegrates; otherwise, it becomes a *ring of protection +1* when all the charges are used.

**Memory:** This ring can only be used by a spell-caster. It allows the wearer to recall any one spell cast. The wearer must decide, within 1 turn of casting a spell, to recall it; the memory then reappears and the spell is instantly "relearned." The ring can restore the memory of one spell per day.

**Plant Control:** This ring has the same effect as the potion of the same name, but only lasts as long as the wearer concentrates.

**Protection +1, +2, +3, or +4:** This ring improves the wearer's armor class by 1, 2, 3, or 4, as listed. For example, a *ring of protection +3* worn by a magic-user with no armor (AC 9) would give the magic-user an AC of 6 while he wears the ring. This item also adds its bonus to all of the wearer's saving throws; in the example here, the magic-user would get a +3 bonus to saving throws.

A variation of this ring is the *ring of protection +1, 5' radius*. This ring improves the wearer's armor class and saving throws by 1 (as a normal *ring of protection +1*), but the ring also gives the same bonus to all creatures within 5'—both friend and foe! No rings affecting an area are more powerful than +1.

**Quickness:** Once each day, the wearer of this ring can move and attack at double normal rates for 1 turn. The effect is identical to the magic-user spell *haste*, but this effect can be produced by command, not by spellcasting.

**Regeneration:** The wearer regenerates lost hit points at the slow rate of 1 per turn. The ring also replaces lost limbs; a finger will regrow in 24 hours, and a whole limb can be replaced in one week. The ring will not function if the wearer's hit points drop to 0 or less. Fire and acid damage cannot be regenerated.

**Remedies:** Once each day, this ring will produce one remedy—a *cure blindness, cure disease, remove curse, or neutralize poison* spell effect. Each effect is identical to the cleric spell of the same name and is treated as if cast by a 25th level cleric. The ring produces the effect desired when the wearer concentrates and touches the recipient.

**Safety:** The effect of this ring is similar to that of a *potion of luck*. If the ring's wearer fails a saving throw, his *player* may "change fate" by announcing that his saving throw was, in fact, successful. The ring will negate  $ext{ld4}$  failed saving throws and then disintegrate.

**Seeing:** Once each day, the wearer of this ring can see all things plainly, as if the cleric spell *true sight* were cast. The wearer need not be a spellcaster. The effect lasts for 3 turns.

**Spell Eating:** Although this ring appears and functions as a *ring of spell turning*, it has an extra, detrimental effect if the user is a spellcaster. After the spellcaster has cast a spell while the ring is worn, the ring "eats" all the remaining spells memorized by the spellcaster. The ring cannot be removed after it has eaten the wearer's spells

(though spells can be restudied and safely cast) until a *remove curse* is applied by a 25th or higher level spellcaster. This remedy only permits the removal of the ring and does not affect its powers. A *dispel evil* cast by a 36th level caster will turn the ring into a normal *ring of spell turning*.

**Spell Storing:** When found, this ring has  $ext{ld6}$  spells stored within it. Those exact spells are the limit of the ring's powers and they cannot be changed. When the ring is put on, the wearer magically knows what spells are stored and how to use them. After a spell is used, it may be replaced by a spellcaster who must cast the replacement spell directly at the ring. The ring will not absorb spells thrown at the wearer. The spells in the ring have the duration, range, and effect equal to the lowest level needed to cast them. The DM should select the type of spells in the ring; about 20% of these rings typically contain clerical spells.

**Spell Turning:** This ring reflects  $ext{2d6}$  spells back to their casters (per day) so that the wearer is not affected by spell attacks. Only spells are reflected, not spell-like powers of monsters or spell-like effects from items. Once the ring's number of spells is reached, it becomes useless for the rest of the day.

**Survival:** The wearer can survive without air, food, or drink while the ring is worn by using the charges contained within it. The ring contains  $ext{ld100} + 100$  (101-200) charges when found. By spending one charge, the user needs no food or drink for 24 hours. Survival without air requires one charge per hour. The ring turns black when five or fewer charges remain.

**Telekinesis:** The wearer may slowly move inanimate objects weighing up to 2,000  $ext{cm}$  by concentration alone, up to a distance of 50'.

**Truth:** Three times per day, this ring allows the wearer to know whether a spoken statement is true or false. Note that if the person or creature uttering the statement *believes* it to be true, a "true" result will be obtained. By telepathy, the ring tells the wearer of its powers as soon as it is worn.

**Truthfulness:** This item claims to be a *ring of truth* when worn (as above), but actually it functions differently. When the wearer first tries to determine the truth of a statement, the statement will appear to be true—but thereafter, the wearer will be unable to lie. The wearer must provide full and completely true answers to any question asked of him so long as he wears the ring. He cannot remove the ring until a *remove curse* is applied by a 26th or higher level caster.

**Truthlessness:** This item also claims to be a *ring of truth* when worn, but it functions in a manner opposite that of a *ring of truthfulness*—that is, the wearer is unable to tell the truth and must lie at all times. The ring cannot be removed until a *remove curse* spell, cast by a 26th or higher level caster, is applied.

**Water Walking:** The wearer of this ring may walk on the surface of any body of water and will not sink.

**Weakness:** When this ring is put on, the wearer becomes weaker and his Strength score becomes 3 within  $ext{ld6}$  rounds. The wearer cannot take off this ring unless a *remove curse* spell is used. If more than one ring is worn per hand, this ring will still function despite the other rings' effects being canceled.

Wishes: A ring of wishes is an extremely powerful item. Wishes must be handled very carefully by the DM and the players alike. To find the number of wishes contained, roll 1d10.

| 1-4 | 1 |
|-----|---|
| 5-7 | 2 |
| 8-9 | 3 |
| 10  | 4 |

X-ray Vision: The wearer may see a distance of up to 30', even through a wall and into the space beyond, by standing still and concentrating. The effect may be blocked by gold or lead. The wearer can inspect one 10' x 10' area per use (which requires a full turn), and he will be able to see any traps or secret doors in the area examined. The ring allows the wearer to see through items less dense than stone (such as cloth, wood, or water) more easily, to a range of 60'. The ring may be used up to 1 turn per hour.

## Miscellaneous Magical Items

Each of the items listed in this section may be used by any character class and up to once per round, unless noted otherwise. Most of the given effects either work automatically or are activated by concentration alone.

There is no limit to the many types of magical items possible; the devices and effects given here are a mere sampling. The DM may create others as desired, with nearly any powers as appropriate. However, when designing such items, keep the balance of the game in mind. If an item duplicates clerical powers, for example, it may cause clerics themselves to become less useful in the game. Keep such items rare and limit them by giving them expendable charges, lest they adversely affect the game.

## Miscellaneous Item Descriptions

The magical items listed in Magical Item Subtable: 5. Miscellaneous Items, page 229, are described in the following text.

Amulet of Protection from Crystal Balls and ESP: The wearer of this item is automatically protected from being spied on by anyone using a crystal ball or any type of ESP.

Bag of Devouring: This item looks like a normal small sack, but anything placed within it disappears. Anyone may reach in and find the contents by touch—if the contents are still there! If the contents are not removed within 1d6 + 1 (7-12) turns, they will be forever lost. The bag will not affect living creatures unless the entire creature is stuffed inside the bag. This is impossible to do except with very small creatures.

Bag of Holding: This bag looks like a normal small sack, but any items placed within it disappear. Anyone may reach in and find the contents by touch. The bag will actually hold treasures up to 10,000 cn in weight, but will only weigh 600 cn when full. An item to be placed inside the bag may be no larger than 10' x 5' x 3'. A larger item will not fit inside.

Boat, Undersea: This item appears identical to a standard riverboat (see Chapter 4) and can be used as one. As it is magical, however, its armor

class is 4 and it has 40 hull points. It is operated by a magical command word that its maker knows; characters who find an *undersea boat* may have to go on an adventure to discover the boat's command word. If the command word is known, no rowers or sailors are required. The boat will obey commands to start, stop, turn to port (left), turn to starboard (right), stop turning (while keeping the same speed), submerge, level off, and surface. When underwater, the boat radiates a *water breathing effect*, protecting all passengers and crew as long as they touch it. The *undersea boat* can be fitted with grips so that the passengers can avoid drifting away.

Note: The DM may wish to create similar magical boats that travel only on ice, sand, in the air, and so forth.

Boots of Levitation: The wearer may *levitate* (as if using the magic-user spell). There is no limit to the duration.

Boots of Speed: The wearer may move as fast as a riding horse (240' [80']) for 12 hours, after which the wearer must rest for one full day.

Boots of Traveling and Leaping: The wearer needs no rest during normal movement. The wearer may also make mighty jumps, to a maximum height of 10' and a maximum length of 30'.

Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals: This item may be used only once per day. The bowl is 3' in diameter; it requires 1 turn to use. The bowl will summon a water elemental and will allow the user to control it, subject to normal rules for elemental control.

Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals: This item may be used only once per day. It requires 1 turn to use and will summon a fire elemental that will allow the user to control it, subject to normal rules for elemental control.

Broom of Flying: When verbally commanded, the broom will carry its owner through the air at 240' per turn. One other person (or up to 2,000 cn of baggage) may also be carried, but the broom slows to 180' per turn.

Censer of Controlling Air Elementals: This item may be used only once per day and requires 1 turn to use. The censer will summon an air elemental and will allow the user to control it, subject to normal rules for elemental control.

Chime of Time: This simple metal stick is 3" long and made of a silvery metal. On command, it will keep track of time, chiming every hour on the hour—the chime can be heard by all within 60' (regardless of intervening walls, rock, etc.). If dampened by a *silence*, 15' radius spell, the chime will dispel the *silence* but be dampened to a 30-foot range for that turn.

A second command will cause the chime to turn color. It will turn gold at one end, the color slowly spreading to the other end in an hour's time. A third command word causes the chime to stop ringing or to stop changing color—but not until 1 turn elapses after the command.

Crystal Ball: This item can only be used by an elf or a magic-user. Its owner may look into it and see any place or object thought about as it exists at that time. It will work three times per day, and the image will last for 1 turn. Spells cannot be cast "through" the crystal ball. The more familiar the object or area to be seen, the clearer the picture will be.

Crystal Ball with Clairaudience: This works like a standard crystal ball, but with the added

power to listen to noises through the ears of a creature in the area viewed. It is only usable by a magic-user.

Crystal Ball with ESP: This also works like a standard crystal ball, but with the added power to listen to the thoughts of a creature viewed. It is only usable by a magic-user.

Displacer Cloak: This item warps light rays; the wearer is actually 5' away from the perceived location. The cloak gives a bonus of +2 to the wearer's saving throws vs. spell, wand/staff/rod, and turn to stone attacks. Hand-to-hand attacks on the wearer are penalized by —2 on the attack rolls, and most missile fire will automatically miss.

Drums of Panic: These large kettle drums have no effect on any creatures within 10' of them. When used, however, all creatures 10'-240' away must make a saving throw vs. spell or run away from the user for 3 full turns. If the morale system is used, no saving throw is needed, but each creature must make a morale check instead, with a penalty of +2 to the roll.

Effreti Bottle: This item is a large, heavy sealed jug about 3' high. If the seal is broken and the stopper pulled, an effreti will come forth to serve the opener once per day for 101 days (or until slain). The creature will return to its home (the fabled City of Brass) after its term of service is ended. It will serve no one but the person opening the bottle.

Egg of Wonder: This strange item is the size of a chicken's egg, but it may be of any color. An egg breaks when dropped or thrown (to 60' maximum range); in the following round, a creature emerges from it and grows to normal size, thereafter obeying the thrower of the egg to the best of its ability. (Note that the creature must be able to hear the user's commands.) The creature will disappear after one hour of existence or when slain. The creature appearing is never determined until the egg actually breaks; characters can never know what creature will appear beforehand. The DM may add other creatures, if desired. To determine the type of creature appearing, roll 1d12.

1. Baboon, rock
2. Bat, giant
3. Bear, black
4. Bear, grizzly
5. Boar
6. Cat, mountain lion
7. Cat, panther
8. Fearet, giant
9. Lizard, gecko
10. Lizard, draco
11. Snake, racer
12. Wolf, normal

Elven Cloak: The wearer of this cloak is nearly invisible (roll 1d6, see only on a 1). The wearer becomes invisible when attacking or casting a spell, and he may not become invisible again for a full turn.

Elven Boots: The wearer of these boots may move with nearly complete silence (roll 1d10; heard only on a 1).

Flying Carpet: This item can carry one passenger at up to 300' per turn, two at 240' per turn, or three at 180' per turn. It will not carry more than three passengers and their equipment. As an option, the DM can say that the carpet will carry an encumbrance of 6,000 cn, but the

# Chapter 16: Treasure

weight of the passengers will have to be calculated.

**Gauntlets of Ogre Power:** These gauntlets will give the wearer a Strength score of 18, gaining all normal bonuses. If the wearer is not using a weapon, he can strike with one fist each round, gaining a +3 on hit rolls, for 1d6 points of damage.

**Girdle of Giant Strength:** This item gives the wearer the same chances to hit as a hill giant. The wearer does double damage with whatever weapon he is using.

**Helm of Alignment Changing:** This item looks like a fancy helmet. When the helm is put on, it will immediately change the wearer's alignment (the DM should determine the new alignment randomly). This device can only be taken off by using a *remove curse* spell, but the wearer will resist seeking the removal. Once it is removed, however, the wearer's original alignment will return. As an option, the DM may allow the character to remove the helm by performing a special task or adventure.

**Helm of Reading:** The wearer is able to read any writing, regardless of the language or magical properties of the script. This does not allow characters to use spell scrolls unless they can do so normally. This helm is fragile, however, and will be destroyed if the wearer is killed. Any hit on the wearer might (10% chance) destroy the helm.

**Helm of Telepathy:** This item looks like a fancy helmet. The wearer of this helm may send messages, by mere thought, to any creature within 90'. The creature receiving the thought messages will understand them. (The creature may refuse to respond.) The wearer may also read the thoughts of a living creature within range. To make the

helm work, the wearer must concentrate on the creature, and he may not move or cast spells. If the creature fails a saving throw vs. spells (or permits the thought reading), the wearer will understand the creature's thoughts.

**Helm of Teleportation:** Usable by magic-users only, this helm allows the wearer to *teleport* (as the magic-user spell, including chances of error) himself or to attempt to teleport another creature or item. An unwilling victim can make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. After one use, the helm will no longer function. If a *teleport* spell is then cast upon it, the user can then teleport as often as desired, up to once per round, without using charges. However, whenever the helm is used to teleport another item or creature, it again becomes useless, requiring another *teleport* spell to reactivate it.

**Horn of Blasting:** This horn creates a cone of sound, 100' long and 20' wide at the far end, when blown. Victims within this area take 2d6 points of damage and must make a saving throw vs. spells or be deafened for one turn; constructions and ships take 1d8 points of damage. The horn may be blown but once per turn.

**Lamp, Hurricane:** This item appears and functions as a *lamp of long burning* in all respects, but only after its storm has passed, as described hereafter.

This lamp is always closed when found. When the shutters are opened, violent gusts of wind and rain come from the lamp, dousing the holder (who gets no saving throw) and all others within 30'. This "hurricane" lasts for 3 rounds; each victim must make a saving throw vs. spells, and all those failing are knocked over from the

winds. If this occurs, every item carried (excluding body clothing and/or armor but including caps, gloves, treasure, etc.) is blown about, landing scattered within 60'. A successful saving throw indicates that the victim has fallen to the ground in time, tightly grasping all items carried. The *hurricane lamp* may thereafter be used as a *lamp of long burning* for the remainder of the day. It resets its "hurricane" effect every 24 hours, which must again be triggered before the lamp can be of more beneficial use.

**Lamp of Long Burning:** This item is identical to a normal adventurer's lantern. It is made of metal, with a lower compartment for oil, a handle, and shutters around the body to protect the flame from wind. When filled with oil and lit as a normal lantern, it will burn and shed light without using oil. If the flame is ever doused by water, the *lamp of long burning* becomes nonmagical.

**Medallion of ESP, 30' Range:** This magical medallion is strung on a chain and worn around the neck. If the wearer concentrates for 1 round, he may read the thoughts of any one creature within 30'. The wearer may move normally but cannot fight or cast spells while concentrating. The DM must roll 1d6 each time this item is used; it will not work properly on a roll of 1. If a 1 occurs, the medallion will broadcast the thoughts of the user to everyone within 30'. The DM may allow a saving throw vs. spells to prevent the medallion from reading a creature's thoughts.

**Medallion of ESP, 90' Range:** This item is identical to the medallion of ESP, 30' range, except that it has a greater range.

**Mirror of Life Trapping:** This unique item stores man-size or smaller creatures for an indefinite period. Any such creature who looks into the mirror must make a saving throw vs. spells or be sucked into it (complete with all equipment and treasure!). The mirror can store up to 20 creatures; when it is full, no more can be trapped. Creatures trapped in the mirror do not age or need food or air, but they are completely powerless. Anyone can talk with the creatures trapped in the mirror (if they speak the same language). If the mirror is broken, all the creatures trapped within are immediately released. However, trapped individuals can be recovered without harming the mirror by using a *wish*.

**Muzzle of Training:** This item is a device of leather straps with metal buckles and may be fastened over the mouth of any animal or monster that has a bite attack. It will magically expand or contract to fit the creature, and the victim can breathe but cannot bite (or talk) while wearing the muzzle. The muzzle will lock in place with a command word (treat as a *wizard lock* by a 15th level caster) and will unlock and fall off with a second command. The muzzle can be commanded as often as desired.

**Nail, Finger:** This item appears identical to the common iron nail of medieval carpentry, 1"–4" long and very crudely made. It may easily be overlooked if found with other construction materials unless a *detect magic* spell is used.

If mistaken for a *nail of pointing* and commanded to function, the nail disappears. When the user next tries to avoid the attention of an enemy (by hiding, *invisibility*, etc.), the nail reappears as a large glowing finger, pointing at the character for 1d6 rounds. The *finger nail* may reappear during each similar attempt thereafter

(25% chance for each), but a *remove curse* will cause it to vanish forever.

**Nail of Pointing:** This item appears identical to a common carpentry nail. If its command word is known, the user may cause it to point at any nonmagical item named (door, stairway, gold piece, etc.); the nail then turns into a finger of bone and points toward the closest item of that type. It will continue to point at that item for 1 turn and then return to nail form. There is no limit to the range of the nail's detection, but it cannot detect living or undead creatures of any type, nor can it detect any magical item or spell effect. The *nail of pointing* will function once per day.

**Ointment:** This white creamy salve is found in a small wooden box with a cotton swab. If all the salve found is rubbed on any part of the skin of the recipient, a magical effect is produced. All ointments look, smell, and taste the same. To determine the type found, roll 1d6 and consult the following. The DM may add other ointments as desired.

1. **Blessing:** This salve gives the recipient a -2 bonus to armor class and a +2 bonus to all saving throws for 1 turn.
2. **Healing:** This salve cures 2d6 + 2 points of damage.
3. **Poison:** This salve seems to be an *ointment of blessing*, but it is a poison and the recipient must make a saving throw vs. poison, with a -2 penalty to the roll, or die.
4. **Scarring:** This salve seems to be an *ointment of healing*, but instead it inflicts 2d6 points of severe burn damage, which can only be repaired by *ointment of soothing*, a *curse all* spell, or a *wish*.
5. **Soothing:** This salve cures the recipient of all burn damage, whatever the amount and whether magical or normal.
6. **Tanning:** This salve causes all the recipient's skin to turn a bright color (determined randomly from red, yellow, orange, blue, green, or brown). The effect cannot be removed but will gradually wear off in 1d4 months.

**Pouch of Security:** This item is the size of a large sack (capacity 600 cn). Any attempt at stealing the pouch causes it to scream, "I am being stolen!" (in the Common tongue) repeatedly for one hour. Its cries can be heard to 120'. If its owner holds it and commands it to be quiet, it will obey, but it will repeat its cries if stolen again.

**Quill of Copying:** A quill is a large feather that can be dipped in ink and used as a writing implement. Usable only by spellcasters, this quill can be commanded to copy any spell on a scroll. It will copy only one spell per week at most. The original scroll must be burned, and the ashes mixed with rare ink (of 1,000 gp cost). The quill is then placed on a blank scroll along with an inkwell containing the prepared ink. Upon command, the quill starts to write, creating two identical spells on the scroll instead of the single original. If the scroll burnt contains two or more spells, only one spell will be copied—either the lowest level spell or (if more than one are the lowest level) a randomly selected spell. The quill will not copy *protection* scrolls or any other writing except spell scrolls.

Unfortunately, there is a 25% chance per use that the quill will suddenly drain of ink, spoiling the entire scroll upon which it is writing. The blot thus created cannot be removed from the parchment by any means but a *wish*.

**Rope of Climbing:** This 50'-long, thin, strong rope will climb in any direction upon the command of the owner. It can fasten itself to any protruding surface and will support up to 10,000 cn of weight.

**Scarb of Protection:** This item automatically absorbs any curse (whether by spell, scroll, or other effect). It will also absorb a *finger of death* (a cleric's *raise dead* spell, reversed). The scarab will work 2d6 times before becoming worthless.

**Slate of Identification:** This valuable device, usable only by spellcasters, can identify magical items of most sorts. It is a piece of slate (stone) held firmly in an ornate wooden frame, usually about 3" square (though slates of many sizes are possible, both larger and smaller). The user holds the slate horizontally and places a magical item upon it. When the item is lifted off, the name of the item appears on the slate. If an item has command words, one will appear on the slate with each identification. The slate will only repeat itself when all the command words have been revealed.

The slate is easily fooled by *cursed* items, however. And it cannot detect an item's number of charges or special ability. A *poison of poison* will be mistakenly identified as some other type. Any *cursed* item will be identified as a normal item. (These guidelines should be strictly followed, lest the mystery of such items found be ruined.)

The slate may expend up to ten charges per day; items identified require the following numbers of charges per use.

#### Temporary Magical Items

| Potion  | 2 |
|---------|---|
| Missile | 3 |
| Wand    | 4 |
| Staff   | 5 |

#### Permanent Magical Items

| Any permanent magical weapon | 6       |
|------------------------------|---------|
| Armor or shield              | 7       |
| Ring or rod                  | 8       |
| Minor miscellaneous item*    | 10      |
| Major miscellaneous item*    | Special |

- \* The DM's judgment is required as to the value and frequency of such items in the campaign. A "major" item might be identifiable, but only by making the slate useless for 1d4 days.

**Stone of Controlling Earth Elemental:** This item may be used only once per day. The stone is only 6" across, and it requires 1 turn to use. The stone will summon an earth elemental and will allow the user to control it, subject to normal rules for elemental control.

**Talisman of Elemental Travel:** There are five types of talismans. Roll 1d10 to determine the exact item found.

| 1-2  | Lesser Talisman of Air          |
|------|---------------------------------|
| 3-4  | Lesser Talisman of Earth        |
| 5-6  | Lesser Talisman of Fire         |
| 7-8  | Lesser Talisman of Water        |
| 9-10 | Greater Talisman (all elements) |

**Lesser Talisman:** This item is a round amulet that may be found on a chain; there are corresponding types to each of the four elements. It is engraved with a triangle in the center and a symbol above it (one of the ten symbols of the elemental ranks). On the Prime Plane, the user may press the central symbol while casting a *conjure elemental spell*; the talisman will reverse the effect, sending the wearer into the appropriate elemental plane. While wearing the talisman, the user can breathe elemental matter as if it were pure, clean air, and he gains in vision (normally 120'-1,200' range, depending on conditions).

**Greater Talisman:** This item is similar to a *lesser talisman* in powers, but applies to all the elemental planes. It is engraved with the four triangular symbols of the planes, meeting in the center. The ten symbols of all the elemental ranks are inscribed around the edge. If the proper command words are known, the wearer may also force an elemental being to obey instructions. This uses one charge; the talisman can expend up to ten charges per trip into an elemental plane.

**Wheel of Floating:** This item appears identical to a normal wagon wheel, but it enables any wagon upon which it is mounted to float on water. One *wheel of floating* allows a wagon to be towed across a river or stream, carrying up to 10,000 cn weight without sinking. Each additional *wheel of floating* allows 5,000 cn more weight to be carried, to the normal maximum for the wagon of 25,000 cn. Swamp travel is also possible, but at a very slow movement rate unless some water-type draft animal is available.

**A cursed wheel of floating will**, when reaching the center of any river or stream, become stuck at that point and cannot be moved until a *remove curse* is applied by a 15th or higher level caster. This allows progress to continue, but the *curse* will return again at next use until the wheel is destroyed.

**Wheel of Fortune:** This strange device is 10' in diameter, mounted on a stand or wall fixture, and easily rotated. It is decorated with a black-and-white pattern of wedges, all intersecting at the center where a green arrow is mounted; the arrow does not turn with the wheel. Near the rim, each black wedge is adorned by a white skull and each white wedge by a red heart. If the wheel is spun (easily done by any creature of 3 Strength or greater), it rotates for 3 rounds and then comes to rest, with the green arrow pointing at one of the wedges (either black or white with equal chances for each). However, a *charmed* creature cannot move the wheel, and each user can spin the wheel only once per day.

If the wheel has spun freely for 3 rounds, not touched or interfered with in any way, a magical effect occurs, determined by the result of the spin. The wheel cannot be affected by magic of any kind, including *telekinesis*, and it cannot be damaged in any way. A *wish* used to affect the wheel will cause the wheel to vanish, regardless of the *wish*. The wheel cannot be moved except by a creature of 26 or more levels (or Hit Dice). The wheel weighs 20,000 cn. For each white or black wedge that appears, roll 1d6 and consult the following.

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_241_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 16: Treasure

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_241_Picture_2.jpeg)

## White Wedge

1. 1,000 gold pieces appear
2. 10 garnets appear
3. 1 brooch appears
4. 1 miscellaneous magical item appears
5. 1 ability score rises by 1 point (maximum score 18)
6. Prime Requisite or Constitution rises by 1 point (maximum score 18)

## Black Wedge

1. 1 ability score drops by 1 point (minimum score 3)
2. Prime Requisite drops by 1 point
3. Constitution drops by 1 point
4. Least valuable magical item carried disintegrates
5. All nonmagical items, except for normal clothing, disintegrate
6. Die (no saving throw)

The DM may select or randomly determine the results of the spin. If desired, the wedges may be numbered from 1-20, 1-100, or some other conveniently determined number, and a chart may be made with more varied results.

Wheel, Square: This odd "wheel," the size of a normal wagon wheel, is useless on roads and other flat terrain because it is perfectly square. However, when mounted properly on a wagon, it magically allows movement through mountain and desert terrain where there is no road. A wagon with one *square wheel* can be pulled by two horses and can move at 20/turn; with two wheels, 30/turn; with three, 40/turn; and with four, the normal rate of 60/turn is possible.

## Armor and Shields

To use the Magical Item Subtable: 6. Armor and Shields on page 230, roll 1d100 to determine the size of armor and check the appropriate column. Then roll 1d100 to determine type of armor (leather, banded, plate, etc.). If a result indicates a type of armor not used in a DM's campaign (for instance, some DMs don't allow suit armor), reroll for a new result. Using the appropriate column for the type of armor (or shield) identified on the Armor Class Modifier subtable, check for the AC modifier and *subtract* the bonus from the base AC rating for that type of armor. Also check for the chance of special powers on the same subtable. If the percentage listed or less is rolled for the special power, consult the Special Powers subtable. (Special powers are described below.)

The base armor classes and the final AC ratings when modified by a magical bonus are outlined below. Keep in mind that a shield, is used, has its AC added to that of the character's armor.

| Base | Armor       | Armor Class Modifier |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| AC   | Type        | +1 +2 +3 +4 +5       |
| 7    | Leather     | 6 5 4 3 2            |
| 6    | Scale mail  | 5 4 3 2 1            |
| 5    | Chain mail  | 4 3 2 1 0            |
| 4    | Banded mail | 3 2 1 0 -1           |
| 3    | Plate mail  | 2 1 0 -1 -2          |
| 0    | Suit armor  | -1 -2 -3 -4 -5       |
| -1   | Shield      | -3 -4 -5 -6          |

For example, a fighter who came across *chain mail* +3 and exchanged her normal scale mail

(AC 6) for the new armor would now be AC 2. If she also happened upon a magical *shield* +2 and chose to use it, her armor class would become -1 (AC 2 + -3 = -1).

The actual types of armor were described in Chapter 4. Magical versions are identical in class restrictions, and these restrictions must still be observed by characters.

Note that armor and shields made for humans, dwarves, and elves are considered "normal-sized," while halfling equipment is counted as much smaller and giant equipment much larger. For instance, a halfling shield offers no protection to a normal-sized character, but a normal-sized shield may be used by anyone—including a halfling. And a giant-sized shield is considered double normal size for a +2 bonus to armor class.

## Cursed Armor and Shields

Armor and shields may be *cursed*. The DM should roll 1d8 when either is placed as treasure; a result of 1 indicates that the item is *cursed*. *Cursed* armor, when first worn, appears to be armor of the type originally rolled on the armor and shields subtable. When the character first goes into combat with monsters, however, the armor makes the character easier to hit by a penalty equal to the bonus rolled. Once it has revealed its true nature, the armor will not come off its wearer; someone will have to cast a *remove curse* to cancel the *curse* long enough for the character to remove the armor. Or a 36th level cleric can cast a *remove curse* to remove the *curse* permanently, and the wearer may then enjoy his magical armor with the proper benefits.

## Special Power Descriptions

Armor and shields can have special powers that can be used once per day at most, unless noted otherwise. When *both* the armor and shield worn have special powers, only one effect can be produced per round at the user's choice unless noted otherwise in the description. Note that armor and shields that have special powers are usable by any class that can use armor and shields; there are no other restrictions.

The powers listed in the Special Powers subtable (in the Magical Item Subtable: 6. Armor and Shields, page 229) are described in the following text.

Absorption: If the user is hit by a blow that would cause an energy drain, the armor or shield absorbs the draining effect and only the normal damage affects the user. Each energy drain causes the loss of one AC bonus modifier from the armor or shield. When reduced to zero bonuses, the item crumbles to dust. (For instance, a *shield* +3 that has absorbed two energy drain attacks is now only a *shield* +1. If it absorbs yet another energy drain, it is reduced to zero and disintegrates.) This special power is not under the control of the user; a character cannot choose to suffer the energy drain and leave the item intact. The normal limit of one use per day does not apply to this power.

Charm: When the user is hit by an opponent, the opponent must make a saving throw vs. spells or become *charmed* by the user of the special armor or shield (as the magic-user spell *charm person* or *charm monster*). If a hand-held

weapon is used in the attack, the opponent gains a +4 bonus to the saving throw. Only one victim can be *charmed* each day, but any number of saving throws may be made before the *charm* is successful.

Cure Wounds: The armor or shield can cure half of the damage the user has incurred, whatever that amount may be, once per day. It can only cure the user, not another creature, and it cannot affect poison, disease, or any other damage but wounds.

Electricity: The armor or shield can, on command of the user, become charged with magical electrical force. If the user is hit while "charged," the attacker takes 6d6 points of electrical damage. The attacker may make a saving throw vs. spells to take half damage; if a weapon is used in the attack, a +4 bonus to the saving throw applies. The armor or shield can be charged or neutralized as often as desired by using command words, but it can only cause damage ("discharge") once per day.

Energy Drain: The armor or shield can become "charged" on command (as described under the electricity special power), but instead of inflicting damage, it causes the loss of one of the opponent's levels or Hit Dice (as if a wight). The same saving throw as the electricity power applies (possibly with bonuses); if successful, the energy drain does not occur. The item can drain one level or Hit Die per day, but any number of saving throws may be made before this occurs.

Ethereality: The user may become ethereal on command and may remain ethereal for as long as desired. The user may return to the Prime Plane when a second command word is spoken. Each command word may be used once per day.

Fly: When commanded, the armor or shield creates a *fly* spell effect on the user, which lasts for 12 turns. The user may then travel in the air at up to 360° per turn by mere concentration (as per the 3rd level magical spell).

Gaseous Form: This valuable armor or shield enables the user to turn into a cloud of gas (as the *poison of gaseous form*), including all equipment carried (unlike the potion). The user can remain gaseous for up to 6 turns and can return to normal form by mere concentration.

Haste: When commanded, the armor or shield creates a *haste* spell effect on the user, allowing double normal movement and number of attacks (as the 3rd level magic-user spell). The *haste* lasts for only 1 turn and is usable only once per day.

Invisibility: When commanded, the armor or shield makes the user *invisible*, as if the 2nd level magic-user spell were cast. In addition, the armor or shield can itself become invisible three times per day, on command of the user.

Reflection: If a *light* or *continual light* spell is cast at the user, the armor or shield will automatically reflect it back at the caster, who must make a saving throw vs. spells or be blinded (as given in the respective spell descriptions). The item will reflect up to three spells per day. In addition, when the user is in melee against a creature with a gaze attack, the chances of gaze reflection are the same as if a mirror were held but without the —2 penalty to the user's attack rolls (which represents the awkwardness of holding the mirror and attempting to attack at the same time).

Remove Curse: This armor or shield cannot it-

self be *cursed* when found. When commanded, the item will create a *remove curse* spell effect on the user only as if a 36th level caster (automatically removing one curse). Note: This item will function a total of three times, at a maximum rate of once per day. After its three charges are used, no other special abilities remain and it cannot be recharged; the item does remain magical, however, regardless of spent charges.

## Missile Weapons and Missiles

A *missile weapon* is a weapon (bow, sling, etc.) that launches ammunition through the air, and a *missile* is the ammunition (arrow, stone, etc.) a missile weapon launches. Normal weapon restrictions apply to magical items as well; for instance, a magic-user cannot use a sling, and he cannot use a magical sling either.

All magical missile weapons have bonuses that give them additional plusses to *both* attack and damage rolls. Magical missiles (such as an *arrow* +2) also have bonuses to both attack and damage rolls.

As noted in the text on "Magical Weapon Subtables," page 228, there are two methods of randomly generating weapons. The first, recommended for character levels 1-10, is a single table. If the DM has decided to place a magical missile weapon or missile in a treasure hoard, he or she can simply roll 1d10 on the Magical Weapon Generation Table (page 230), find the result in the appropriate column, and place the item in the treasure.

When stocking treasure troves with magical missile weapons and missiles for characters who are above level 10, the DM can use the same table—or he or she can use the more specific but more complex method of random treasure generation, the Random Missile Weapon and Missile Generation Checklist.

Note that if both a missile and the missile weapon firing it have bonuses, the *total* of their bonuses and effects will apply in all cases. For example, a crossbow +2 shooting a *quarrel* +3 would have a +5 chance of attack and would do +5 of damage if the attack roll is successful. Likewise, normal arrows shot by a *long bow* +1 can harm gargoyle (which are damaged only by magic).

A magical missile normally becomes non-magical after one use, regardless of whether the attempt hits a target (its bonus to the attack roll disappears). However, if the missile has a talent, a missed shot will not destroy the magic *unless* noted otherwise in the following missile talent descriptions. Usually, if the missile is retrieved after a missed shot, it may be reused with its magical bonuses intact.

## Missile Talent Descriptions

The talents listed in the Missile Talents subtable (in the Magical Item Subtable: 7. Missile Weapons and Missiles, page 230) are described in the following text.

Biting: When the missile hits, the talent turns it into a poisonous" snake. In addition to normal damage, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die (or, at the DM's choice, take extra damage; 2d6, 2d10, or 2d20 are recommended amounts).

### Random Missile Weapon and Missile Generation Checklist

1. Roll 1d10 on the Magical Item Subtable: 7. Missile Weapons and Missiles (page 230) to determine the item. Note the weapon class. Missile weapons (such as bows and blowguns) are Class D, while missiles are Class A. (Weapon class is a measure of how difficult it is to construct weapons or ammunition; weapon classes are discussed in full under "Swords," below.)
2. The Magical Item Subtable: 7. Missile Weapons and Missiles is further divided into two subtables: Missile Weapons and Missiles. Once the specific type of magical item has been determined (long bow or quarrels, for example), the DM should check the appropriate suitable and note the following:
   - **For missile weapons**, the DM rolls 1d10 to find the magical bonus (to attack and damage rolls). He or she then rolls 1d4 and adds the die roll to the magical bonus—this result will indicate the range multiplier. (This is an additional bonus a missile weapon may have to extend its ranges; if a bonus is indicated, multiply the weapon's short, medium, and long ranges by the range multiplier—the results will be the magical weapon's true ranges.) Finally, the DM should roll against the percentage listed for the chance of an additional weapon modifier. (The chance listed to be checked is the one that corresponds with the magical bonus first rolled on this subtable.) If the roll is successful, he or she then goes to the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table on page 231 and applies the results. (Additional modifiers include bonuses against a specific opponent and weapon talents.)
   - **For missiles**, the DM rolls 1d10 to find the magical bonus (to attack and damage rolls). He or she then rolls the die indicated for the number of missiles found. Lastly, the DM rolls against the percentage listed for the chance of a missile talent. If the roll is successful, the DM then rolls 1d10 on the Missile Talents subtable (part of the Magical Item Subtable: 7. Missile Weapons and Missiles) to find the missile's specific talent. (Talents are described below.)

Blinking: The missile with this talent will not hit any friend of the user, "blinking" in and out of existence until it reaches an enemy. (If the sight of the enemy is blocked by friends, a penalty may apply to the attack roll).

Charming: The victim hit must make a saving throw vs. spells or be *charmed* by the user (as the *charm person* or *charm monster* magic-user spell).

Climbing: This talent only functions if the missile is shot at an object. The missile securely fastens itself to any object hit and then creates a magical 50' rope, issuing from the spot hit. The rope will support any weight of climbers and will

disappear 1 turn later or upon command of the user. The missile cannot be moved after it hits, and it disappears when the rope does.

Curing: A missile with this talent is obviously blunt, inscribed with a holy symbol. When it hits a living creature, it does not inflict damage. Instead, it cures 2d6 points of damage plus 2 extra points for each magical bonus of the missile. For example, if a 5 is rolled for a *curing arrow* +2, the total points of damage cured are 7.

Disarming: This talent will only function if the victim hit is holding a weapon or other item. The victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or drop the item. A dropped item may normally be recovered in 1 round (unless it falls into a pit or chasm, if someone else grabs it, etc.).

Dispel: When a missile with this talent hits, it creates a *dispel magic* effect centered on the point of impact (a 20' cube) as if cast by a 15th level caster.

Flying: A missile with this talent can be shot at ranges five times greater than normal. If the missile weapon firing this missile is also magical and has an additional range multiplier, the effect is cumulative; multiply each maximum range by five. If the missile weapon is not magical, use the following maximum ranges.

| Arrow, short bow        | 250/500/750   |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Arrow, long bow         | 350/700/1,050 |
| Quarrel, light crossbow | 300/600/900   |
| Quarrel, heavy crossbow | 400/800/1,200 |
| Sling stone             | 200/400/800   |

Lighting: The missile talent can create a *light* spell effect (30' diameter), either upon command or when it hits a target. If a creature is hit, the victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or be blinded by the light (as if the spell had been cast at its eyes). The missile disintegrates when the *light* is created.

Penetrating: A missile with this talent cannot be slowed by underbrush, webs (normal or magical), or other forms of cover. The victim's armor class is not modified by cover of any sort.

Refilling: This talent gives no special effects to a missile when shot. If left in a container with other missiles of the same type (that is, a *refilling arrow* with normal arrows or a *refilling sling stone* with normal sling stones), however, it will magically create 1d20 more missiles of the normal type each day.

Screaming: This talent's effect occurs when the missile is shot, even if it misses the target. As it travels through the air, the missile produces a loud cry, causing all within 30' of its path to check morale. If the morale check is failed, the victims will retreat in fear for 1d8 rounds.

Seeking: This talent will only function when the missile is shot at an object; it is not usable against creatures. It will automatically hit any one target object within range as long as a path of travel is clear. It may be used as a *missile of disarming*, if desired, or it can be used to sever a normal rope, pierce a sack, push a button, trigger a trap, etc. It will automatically miss any creature at which it is aimed.

Sinking: When shot at a water craft of any sort, a missile with this talent inflicts 1d10 + 10 (11-20) hull points of damage when it hits. (The armor class of the vessel is used, as if the shot were a ramming or catapult attack.)

Slaying: If the die rolls for a missile indicate

# Chapter 16: Treasure

![Illustration depicting a battle scene. A knight in armor is being struck by a missile, while a muscular warrior with a sword and a cleric stand nearby, ready to fight.]()![](_page_243_Picture_1.jpeg)

this talent, go to the Opponents subtable in the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table (page 231) and roll 1d100. The result indicates the missile talent's opponent. When that opponent is hit by this missile, the victim must make a saving throw vs. death ray or die.

**Speaking:** A missile with this talent will miss any creature at which it is shot. It is used for communication purposes only. The user may give the missile any message of 20 words or less and then shoot it, either naming a place within ten miles or aiming at a target. The missile will automatically land on the floor or ground in the target area and will repeat the message aloud twice.

**Stunning:** The victim hit by a missile with this talent must make a saving throw vs. spells or be stunned for 1d6 rounds.

**Teleporting:** A victim hit by a missile with this talent must make a saving throw vs. spells (at a +2 bonus to the roll) or be teleported to a point 1d100 miles away, with the direction and distance determined randomly. Unlike the effect of the magic-user spell, the victim cannot arrive in the air or within a solid object.

**Transporting:** A victim hit by a missile with this talent must make a saving throw vs. spells or be sent to a point up to 360° away, as determined by the user of the missile. The effect is identical to the magic-user spell *dimension door*, and it cannot cause the victim to appear within a solid object.

**Wounding:** When a missile with the wounding talent strikes a target creature, it inflicts normal damage. In addition, however, it causes the loss of 1 hit point per round thereafter until magical curing is applied (a potion, cure spell of

any type, etc.). However, no undead creature or construct (golem, living statue, etc.) can be wounded with this talent, and such creatures suffer only the initial damage.

## Swords

Normal weapon restrictions for character classes also apply to magical swords. For example, a cleric cannot use a sword, so a cleric cannot use a magical sword either.

A magical sword's bonus is added to both its

attack rolls and damage rolls. Some swords also have an additional bonus that is used *only* when fighting a special type of opponent. Other swords may have bonuses or modifiers such as the ability to cast certain spell effects. The DM may wish to refer to such spells to find the exact effect. Note that each effect can only be used once per day and that no meditating is needed to gain the spellcasting ability.

As noted in the text on "Magical Weapon Subtables," page 228, there are two methods of randomly generating swords. The first, recom-

### Random Sword Generation Checklist

1. Roll 1d100 on the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords (page 231) to determine the type of sword. Note the weapon class. Short and normal swords are Class C, while bastard and two-handed swords are Class D. (Weapon class is discussed in full below.)
2. Roll 1d100 again and check the appropriate weapon class column for the magical attack and damage bonus. Roll 1d100 against the percentage listed for the chance of an additional modifier; if the roll is successful, see the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table on page 231 and apply the results. (Additional modifiers include bonuses against a specific opponent and weapon talents.)
3. Since all magical swords have a chance of intelligence, check the Intelligence of Sword subtable (in the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords) by again rolling 1d100. The result will indicate the sword's intelligence (if any), method of communication (if any), languages known (if any), and number of powers (if any). (These abilities are explained below.)
4. If the sword is intelligent, determine alignment and ego as indicated in the text below under "Sword Alignment, Ego, and Control Checks." Also do a control check to see if the intelligent sword will control its user.
5. The powers available to a sword include primary powers, extraordinary powers, and the ability to read magic on command. If a primary or extraordinary power is indicated for a sword, go to the Primary and Extraordinary Powers subtable (in the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords) and roll 1d100 in the appropriate column. If more than one power was indicated, roll as necessary, ignoring any duplicate rolls except those that are allowed.

mended for character levels 1-10, is a single table. If the DM has decided to place a magical sword in a treasure hoard, he or she can simply roll 1d100 on the Magical Weapon Generation Table (page 230), find the result in the appropriate column, and place the item in the treasure.

When stocking treasure troves with magical swords for characters who are above level 10, the DM can use the same table—or he or she can use the more specific but more complex method of random sword generation, the Random Sword Generation Checklist.

## Weapon Class

Magical weapons typically must be made by a special procedure, usually performed by a magic-user or cleric working in conjunction with a blacksmith or armorer. *Weapon class* is a measure of the difficulty of that item's construction. The weapon tables give the weapon class for each weapon. Generally, Class A weapons are small and temporary magical items, the most frequently found; Class D weapons are the largest and rarest as they require the most work.

At the DM's option, other new weapons may be invented. Each new weapon should be categorized as to one of the four weapon classes, which are as follows:

- *Class A* weapons are temporary items; they normally become nonmagical once used, even if the attack roll indicated a miss. Magical missiles fall into this category.
- *Class B* weapons include all thrown weapons (javelin, spear, etc.) and small melee weapons.
- *Class C* weapons are larger hand-held items, including short swords and normal swords.
- *Class D* weapons are two-handed items (including bastard swords) and all missile weapons.

## Designing Special Swords

Naturally, the DM may not want to leave the nature of special swords in a campaign entirely to chance. It's entirely appropriate to create special swords that accomplish certain feats in a campaign. If one campaign goal in a campaign is the destruction of a certain dragon, for instance, the DM may wish to introduce a dragon-slaying sword into a treasure trove acquired by the player characters.

To create a magical sword from the ground up, follow the procedure described above for rolling up swords, but *choose*, don't roll, the sword's attributes. Keep in mind, however, that the weapon will remain long after the campaign has ended, so avoid creating swords that are too powerful and that may be a problem in future campaigns.

## Cursed Swords

Any sword may be *cursed*. When the die rolls indicate a sword as treasure, roll 1d20. If the result is a 1 or 2, place a *cursed sword* in the treasure instead.

A *cursed sword* will seem to be a normal magical sword (whatever type was first rolled) until used in combat. At that time, the *curse* is revealed. When using that weapon, the sword will cause the player to *subtract* the amount that was

to have been a bonus from all attack and damage rolls. (For example, if a character believes he is carrying a *sword* + 3 when in fact he is carrying a *cursed sword*, he will subtract 3 from both his attack and damage rolls.)

Once a character uses the *cursed sword* in battle, he may not throw it away: He is under a compulsion to keep it and use it. If it is stolen or sold, the character is *cursed* with the desire to get it back. The character will always use that weapon when in battle. (The DM may have to tell the player that this is what the character wants—and no arguments!—until the character is rid of the curse.)

Only a spellcaster with a *dispel evil* or *remove curse* spell can help a character be rid of the weapon. If the spellcaster is less than 26th level, the spell simply cures the character of his compulsion; he may now get rid of the *cursed sword*. If the spellcaster is 26th level or above, however, the *dispel evil* or *remove curse* spell will permanently change the *cursed sword* into a normal magical sword of whatever type was originally rolled.

## Sword Abilities

Although magical swords can be easily and quickly generated from the Magical Weapon Generation Table on page 230, the text in this section can help add color to a specific sword. This section can also define more specific swords for the DM who uses the Random Sword Generation Checklist. Magical swords, as noted in the optional checklist, can be generated with a number of additional abilities, including:

- Magical bonuses to attack and damage rolls;
- Additional modifiers such as attack and damage bonuses against specific opponents or special talents (as obtained from the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table on page 231);
- Sword intelligence, which allows communication via empathy or speech and languages known (if the sword is intelligent and can speak);
- If intelligent, alignment and ego and a need to control its user (as determined by a control check); and
- Powers, including primary powers, extraordinary powers, and the ability to read magic.

These special sword abilities are outlined in this section.

### Magical Bonuses

All magical swords have a bonus from +1 to +5 that is applied to all attack and damage rolls made by that weapon.

### Additional Modifiers

As noted on the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords (page 231), there is a percentage chance for a magical weapon to have an additional modifier; these modifiers are generated using the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table. Note that magical weapons can have only one additional modifier—either an extra bonus against an opponent or a talent.

The typical weapon modifier is an extra magical bonus against a specific opponent. This is an additional +1 to +5 on attack and damage rolls beyond the weapon's basic magical bonus against the sword's designated opponent. For ex-

ample, a *sword* +1 that the die roll has indicated has a +3 against spellcasters would be a *sword* +1, +4 vs. spellcasters.

A more unusual modifier is a special ability called a *talent*, which may be a spell or some other effect posed by the sword. Swords are more likely to have a talent than are other types of weapons; there is only a 10% chance that a miscellaneous weapon will have a talent, as noted on the Magical Item Subtable: 9. Miscellaneous Weapons (page 231).

Descriptions of additional bonuses and talents can be found in the section on "Additional Weapon Modifiers," below.

### Sword Intelligence, Communication, and Speech

If the 1d100 roll on the Intelligence of Sword suitable in the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords indicates that the sword has an Intelligence of 7 or better, the sword is a very remarkable one indeed. It is intelligent—it is sentient, with a personality and its own goals and mannerisms. Typically, it also has one or more primary or extraordinary powers (described below).

The DM should role-play an intelligent sword just as he or she would any nonplayer character. Note that intelligent swords have *no wisdom*, and thus they should be played accordingly, relying on the owner's wisdom for guidance and decision making.

After finding the sword's Intelligence from the Intelligence of Sword suitable, note how it communicates with its owner, either through *empathy* (a limited telepathy that works only with the person holding the sword and is usable only for communicating thoughts, *not* for reading minds) or through *speech*.

Next, if the sword's Intelligence is 10 or higher, determine how many languages the sword knows. (Roll the die indicated under the languages column of the Intelligence of Sword suitable.)

A sword that speaks automatically knows the Common tongue and its alignment tongue. If it knows more than one language, the DM must determine which languages it speaks. Also note that if a sword has the ability to *read magic*, it can also speak the languages it can read. (The *read magic* ability is discussed below with the primary and extraordinary powers.)

The DM will likely want to come up with a history for the sword—who made it, why it was made, and how it has been used over the years—and then use that history to determine what languages it speaks. For instance, an intelligent sword that has a +2 magical bonus and an additional +3 bonus vs. dragons could have been forged a hundred years ago by a famous dwarf craftsman and then used by a human hero who slew many dragons and drove others away. For these reasons, the sword may speak Common, dwarvish, and dragon, as these languages best correspond to its history.

### Sword Alignment, Ego, and Control Checks

Intelligent swords have alignments just as characters do. To determine the alignment of an intelligent sword, roll 1d20.

| 1-13  | Lawful  |
|-------|---------|
| 14-18 | Neutral |
| 19-20 | Chaotic |

# Chapter 16: Treasure

A character cannot detect a sword's alignment until he picks it up and handles it. If the character handling the sword is of the same alignment, there will be no bad reaction. However, if the alignment is different, the user will take damage each round while holding the sword. Gloves and other protective insulation do not protect the character from this damage, which is as follows.

| Users' Alignment | Sword's Alignment | Damage per Round |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lawful           | Neutral           | 1d6              |
|                  | Chaotic           | 2d6              |
| Neutral          | Lawful            | 1d6              |
|                  | Chaotic           | 1d6              |
| Chaotic          | Lawful            | 2d6              |
|                  | Neutral           | 1d6              |

In addition to alignment, intelligent swords also have egos. Roll 1d12 to determine the ego score of the sword. (Ego is a measure of the strength of a sword's personality.) Then add the sword's Intelligence and ego scores to find its will power. Add 1 to the will power score for each extraordinary power the sword has (if any). Make a note of the total will power of the sword.

A character's will power is the total of the character's Intelligence and Wisdom scores. The DM may subtract 1d8 points of will power if the character is wounded, and if the sword and the user are of different alignments, the sword gains 1d10 points to its will power. (This additional bonus must be determined for each change of users.)

When an intelligent sword is handled, it may try to control its user. The DM must compare the

will power of the sword to that of the user by doing a control check. An intelligent sword will try to control its user in each of five different situations, including the following:

- When the user first handles the sword.
- When the user is wounded and has half or less of his normal hit points remaining.
- When the user acquires any other magical weapon.
- When anyone else uses the sword.
- When a special purpose could be used (if applicable).

To make a control check, the DM simply compares the will power scores of both user and sword, with the higher score taking control. Such control lasts until either the sword is satisfied or the situation that caused the control check has passed. The DM must determine the actions of any sword in control; typical actions include the following:

- Leading the user past magical weapons that the user would have stopped for or causing the user to discard other weapons.
- Forcing the user to charge into combat to win glory for itself.
- Making the user surrender to an opponent—either one more worthy of the sword or one easier for the sword to control.
- Forcing the user to spend money on items for the sword, such as jeweled fittings, fancy scabbards, and so forth.

#### Primary and Extraordinary Powers

The sword's Intelligence determines how many primary and extraordinary powers it has,

![Illustration of a bearded wizard or sorcerer, wearing a pointed hat and robes, holding a sword in his right hand and gesturing with his left hand, standing in front of a stone wall. A dragon is visible in the background.]()![](_page_245_Picture_12.jpeg)

as noted in the Primary and Extraordinary Powers subtable of the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords, page 231. The DM should roll 1d100 once for each primary and extraordinary power of the sword and find the results on the subtable. Duplicate results should be rerolled unless indicated otherwise.

Primary Powers: The user must have the sword in hand and be concentrating on the power in order to use it. Any power may be used once per round. A primary power is usable as often as desired unless noted otherwise. These powers are defined as follows:

- **Detect evil (good).** The sword is able to detect one of these intentions up to a 20' range. No sword can do both; the DM must determine which version the sword can do.
- **Detect gems.** The sword can detect all types of gems and the amount of each within a 60' range, pointing itself in that direction.
- **Detect magic.** The sword can cause all magic within 20' to glow (as the spell effect) up to three times per day.
- **Detect metal.** The sword can detect metal of any type requested up to a range of 60'. It will point in the direction of the material, but it cannot detect the amount.
- **Detect shifting walls and rooms.** The sword can find these items if within 10'.
- **Detect slopes.** The sword can locate all sloping passages within a 10' range.
- **Find secret doors.** The sword can locate all secret doors within a 10' range up to three times per day.
- **Find traps.** The sword can detect traps of all types within 10' up to three times per day.
- **See invisible.** The sword can find all invisible and hidden objects and creatures (but not secret doors) within a 20' range.

Extraordinary Powers: An extraordinary power is only generated if the sword has a 12 or higher Intelligence or if a roll for a primary power gave a result of 96-99. If the sword has an extraordinary power, roll 1d100 and find the power on the Primary and Extraordinary Powers subtable of the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords. Except for the *extra damage* and *healing* powers, duplicate results should be rerolled. An extraordinary power may only be used three times per day unless noted otherwise. These powers are defined as follows:

- **Clairaudience.** As with the potion, the user may hear all noises in one area within 60' through the ears of a creature in that area.
- **Clairvoyance.** As with the potion, the user may see any area up to 60' away through the eyes of a creature in that area.
- **ESP.** As with the potion, the user may listen to the thoughts of any one living creature within 60'.
- **Extra damage.** This power lasts for 1d10 rounds when commanded. The user may inflict *four times* the normal damage on each successful hit. This power may be generated more than once; each duplicate roll increases the multiplier by 1 (to 5 times, 6 times, etc.).
- **Flying.** As with the potion, the user may fly in the air for a maximum of three turns per use.
- **Healing.** The sword with this power can heal up to a total of 6 points of damage per day, at the rate of 1 hit point per round.

This power may be generated more than once; duplicate rolls increase the amount of healing by 6 points each (to 12, 18, etc. per day), but the rate of healing remains the same.

- **Illusion.** The user may create a *phantasmal force*, as with the magic-user spell.
- **Levitation.** As with the potion, the user may float in the air for a maximum of three turns per use.
- **Telekinesis.** The user may move up to 2,000 cm of weight by mere concentration as with the ring.
- **Telepathy.** This is the same as *ESP* (above), but with the ability to "send" thoughts to the creature contacted (as with a helm of telepathy).
- **Teleportation.** The user may teleport once per day as with the magic-user spell.
- **X-ray vision.** The user may see through things as if wearing a ring of X-ray vision.

## Miscellaneous Weapons

Normal weapon restrictions apply to magical miscellaneous weapons as well. For example, since a magic-user cannot use a polearm, a magic-user cannot use a magical polearm, either.

Note: This section is not used for determining magical swords or magical missile weapons; see the appropriate sections above instead.

As with magical swords, a weapon's magical bonus is added to both attack and damage rolls. And as with swords, any item may be *cursed*, though there is less chance than with swords. Roll 1d20; if the result is 1, the item is cursed. The item is handled in the same manner as a *cursed sword*.

Some miscellaneous weapons have an additional bonus that is used *only* when fighting a specific type of opponent. Other weapons may have a talent, the ability to cast certain spell effects. (The DM may wish to refer to such spells to find the exact effect. Note that each effect can only be used once per day and that no meditating is needed to gain the spellcasting ability.)

As noted in the text on "Magical Weapon Subtables," page 228, there are two methods of randomly generating weapons. The first, recommended for character levels 1-10, is a single table. If the DM has decided to place a magical miscellaneous weapon in a treasure hoard, he or she can simply roll 1d100 on the Magical Weapon Generation Table (page 230), find the result in the appropriate column, and place the item in the treasure.

When stocking treasure troves with magical miscellaneous weapons for characters who are above level 10, the DM can use the same table—or he or she can use the more specific but more complex method of random weapon generation, the Random Miscellaneous Weapon Generation Checklist.

Weapon classes are explained above under "Swords."

Unlike swords, miscellaneous weapons are not normally intelligent. If desired, the Intelligence of Sword suitable (from the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords, page 231) may be used, but a penalty of -6% should be applied to the roll. Note that only swords can attain 10 or greater Intelligence.

### Random Miscellaneous Weapon Generation Checklist

1. Roll 1d100 on the Magical Item Subtable: 9. Miscellaneous Weapons (page 231) and find the type of weapon. Note the weapon class of the item.
2. Checking the appropriate weapon class column, roll 1d100 on the Magical Bounces and Modifiers suitable (from the Magical Item Subtable: 9. Miscellaneous Weapons). The result will indicate the basic magical bonus to attack and damage rolls.
3. For a weapon that has a +1 to +4 magical bonus, roll 1d100 against the percentage listed in the subtable. If the roll is successful, go to the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table (page 231) and roll for the additional bonus against a specific opponent.
4. For a weapon that has a +5 magical bonus, roll 1d100 against the percentage listed in the subtable. If the roll is successful, go to the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table and roll on the Talents suitable for a talent instead of a bonus against an opponent.

## Designing Special Weapons

Instead of randomly determining results, the DM may wish to select these weapons with a theme or purpose in mind. For example, if the DM wants to place a special weapon for a cleric, he or she could select a mace or hammer from the Magical Item Subtable: 9. Miscellaneous Weapons, select a bonus against undead (from the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table), and give it a talent for deflecting energy drains (from the Talent subtable in the latter table). In this way, the DM can provide the tools the characters will need for completing special adventures in a campaign.

Remember that the weapon will remain after the crisis is solved. Though the weapon can be later removed from the game (by using thieves, special damage, or various magical means), the DM should avoid placing items that are too powerful and that may cause problems later.

## Returning Weapons

This type of hand-hurled missile weapon will return to the user if it misses the target; it is sometimes called a "boomerang" weapon. If it misses, it returns at the end of the same round and may automatically be safely caught by the character throwing it (unless the user has become paralyzed, confused, immobile, etc.). If it hits the target, the weapon does *not* return by itself.

## Miscellaneous Weapon Abilities

Any miscellaneous weapon can have additional weapon modifiers, such as bonuses against opponents or talents. These abilities are generated using the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table. Such modifiers are described in the following section.

## Additional Weapon Modifiers

Two types of weapon modifiers are generated on the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table on page 231. Unless stated otherwise, the weapon bonuses vs. opponents and the talents listed in this section are applicable to all weapons, including missile weapons, swords, and miscellaneous weapons. Of course, class restrictions apply to items with these modifiers, and a class that cannot use a normal version of a weapon cannot use a magical version that has an additional modifier.

### Weapon Bonus vs. Opponent

This weapon modifier is an additional attack and damage bonus when the weapon is used against a specific opponent (for example, a *sword* +1, +2 vs. *enchanted monsters*). The amount of the bonus may be from +1 to +5 greater than the normal magical bonus of the weapon, as determined by the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table. (For instance, a *sword* +1 that has a +3 bonus against *lycanthropes* would be a *sword* +1, +4 vs. *lycanthropes*.)

The DM should feel free to add more categories to the types of opponents as appropriate, taking care not to upset the balance of the game. The opponent categories listed on the Opponents subtable (from the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table) are as follows:

- **Bugs** includes all normal and giant-sized forms of arachnids (spider, tick, scorpion, etc.), insects (ant, beetle, fly, etc.), and chilopods (centipedes, etc.).
- **Constructs** includes all created monsters such as living statues or golems. Gargoyles are also included in this category.
- **Dragonkind** includes all dragons of all colors and sizes plus draconian monsters such as the chimera, hydra (all types), salamander, and wyvern.
- **Enchanted monsters** includes those creatures that cannot be hit by normal or silver weapons.
- **Giantkind** includes all giants and all giant-type creatures such as ogres, Cyclopes, and other humanoid that are larger than man-size (including characters who have consumed a *potion of growth*).
- **Lycanthropes** includes all types of were-creatures, whether in animal form or not. This includes all characters afflicted with lycanthropy.
- **Planar monsters** includes those creatures that come from the elemental, ethereal, astral, or outer planes. All types are included, but Immortals do not count as planar monsters.
- **Regenerating monsters** includes all creatures that regain more than 1 hit point per day by rest or other means. This includes any creature wearing a *ring of regeneration*.
- **Reptiles and dinosaurs** includes all normal and giant-sized forms of lizards, snakes, turtles, crocodiles, and dinosaurs.
- **Spell-immune monsters** includes those creatures that are immune to 1 or more spell levels, as specified in the monster descriptions (such as drakes) in Chapter 14. This does not include creatures that are immune

# Chapter 16: Treasure

merely to certain specific spells (such as the undead immunity to *sleep*, *charm*, and *hold*).

- *Spellcasters* includes all clerics, elves, magic-users, and other creatures able to use spells (such as paladins or spirits, for example).
- *Undead* includes all types of undead creatures, both land and water, from skeleton to lich.
- *Water-breathing monsters* includes those creatures able to breathe water, including characters under the influence of a *potion* or *ring of water breathing*. Note that aquatic mammals (whale, dolphin, etc.) breathe air and are not included in this category.
- *Weapon-using monsters* includes those creatures that have weapons in hand (not claws) at the time of a melee. For example, a wererat wielding a sword would be affected by this additional bonus, but the wererat would not be affected if it were attacking only with its bite.

## Talents

Talents are unusual magical powers that various weapons can have (though they are most often applied to swords). They are not the same as a sword's primary or extraordinary powers, which are described later, and a sword can have both a talent and primary and extraordinary powers. Talents can be certain spell effects or some other useful ability.

All talents may be used only once per day unless noted otherwise. Talents that duplicate spell effects are *not* actual spells, and they require neither verbal casting nor concentration. The use of a talent occurs in the *magical spells and items* phase of a combat round. The talents listed on the Talents subtable (from the Additional Weapons Modifiers Table, page 231) are as follows:

- *Breathing*. The weapon with this talent can create either one *water breathing* spell effect per day or one *air breathing* effect per day. *Air breathing* supplies only the user with pure air for 1 turn, and it can be used to counter the effects of airlessness, poisoned air (such as a gas trap), and so forth; however, it *cannot* negate the effects of any breath weapon.
- *Charming*. The talent can create one *charm person* spell effect per day to a 120° range (as the 1st level magic-user spell).
- *Deceiving*. The weapon with this talent can be commanded to change the appearance of the user. The size cannot be changed, but facial features, equipment carried, etc. can all be modified. This is only an illusion; the user remains intact. The weapon must be held to create the disguise (unsheathed in the case of edged weapons), and it cannot disguise itself.
- *Defending*. The bonus of the weapon may be used normally (applying to attack and damage rolls) with this talent or as a bonus to the armor class of the user. A missile weapon cannot have this talent (roll again).
- *Deflecting*. If the user is hit by a blow that would cause an energy drain, the talent can automatically deflect the blow. After the opponent hits, the user may decide whether to deflect the blow. If used for deflecting, the weapon absorbs the effect of the energy drain

![Illustration of a muscular warrior, possibly a barbarian or magic-user, fighting a large, scaly, dragon-like monster with a sword.]()![](_page_247_Picture_7.jpeg)

but at the cost of one magical bonus, which is drained from the weapon for each energy drain negated. If an energy drain deflected reduces the bonuses to below zero (such as a *sword +1* deflecting a specter's attack, which causes a double energy drain), the weapon disintegrates; the extra drain does not affect the user. If a missile weapon has this talent, it must be held in hand to deflect the blow (and cannot be used at melee range).

- *Draining*. Upon command, the weapon with this talent can drain one level or Hit Die when it strikes an opponent (as if a *wraith*), in addition to normal damage. The command may be spoken after the attack roll is made. The weapon can drain 1d4+4 levels or Hit Dice in all; it then loses this ability forever. Energy drain cannot affect any creature that has energy drain powers (wight, wraith, specter, etc.). If a missile weapon has this talent, it may be applied to any missile shot, but each level drained also drains one magical bonus from the weapon. If the weapon becomes nonmagical because of this loss, it loses the ability to energy drain as well.
- *Extinguishing*. The weapon with this talent is cool to the touch. When used against a fire-using creature (such as a red dragon or fire elemental, for example) the magical bonus of the weapon is doubled. In addition, the weapon will douse a normal fire if thrust into it. It has no effect on magical fire. If a missile weapon has this talent, it applies to all missiles fired instead of to the weapon itself.
- *Finding*. The talent can create one *locate object* spell effect per day to a 120° range (as

the 2nd level magic-user spell).

- *Flaming*. The point or edge of this weapon that has this talent will blaze with flames upon command. The flames will not harm the weapon or the user, but they will add a +2 bonus to attack rolls against hippogriffs, pegasi, rocs, and trolls and a +3 bonus against treants and undead monsters. The bonus applies to both attack and damage rolls. The flame may easily be used to light a torch, lantern, or other flammable item. If a missile weapon has this talent, it applies to all missiles fired instead of the weapon itself.
- *Flying*. The weapon with this talent can fly in the air and attack by itself. In battle, it must first be used normally at least once. If then commanded to fly, it will continue to attack the same opponent for three more rounds, returning to its master after that time (or when commanded to return). Its attack rolls are made as if it were wielded normally, based on the class and level of the user. If a missile weapon has this talent, it creates normal missiles as it shoots; the owner does not have to supply it with new missiles, and he cannot supply it with magical missiles to shoot.
- *Healing*. This talent can create one *curse serious wounds* spell effect per day, curing the user only of 2d6 + 2 points of damage (as the 4th level cleric spell).
- *Hiding*. The weapon with this talent can create one *invisibility* spell effect on only the user when commanded to do so. In addition, the weapon can itself become invis-

ble three times per day.

- **Holding.** This talent can create one *hold person* spell effect per day to a 180° range (as the 2nd level cleric spell).
- **Lighting.** The weapon that has this talent can create one *light* spell effect per day to a 120° range and lasting for 6 turns (similar to the 1st level magic-user spell).
- **Silencing.** This talent can create one *silence, 15' radius* spell effect per day to 180° range (as the 2nd level cleric spell).
- **Slicing.** This talent applies only to edged weapons (swords daggers, etc.). If any other weapon type indicates this talent, roll again. If the edged weapon's attack roll is 19 or 20 *counting the weapon's magical bonus but no other bonuses*, the opponent struck must make a saving throw vs. death ray or be struck dead with one blow. If the saving throw is successful, the victim still takes triple normal damage from the blow. These special damage bonuses do not apply when the weapon is used against constructs or undead creatures of any sort.
- **Slowwing.** When a successful hit is made, the weapon with this talent can cause the opponent struck to become *slowed* (as the reverse of the 3rd level magic-user spell *haste*) for 1 turn (no saving throw). The user may decide whether or not to use this effect *after* the swing hits.
- **Speeding.** The talent will, on command, create a *haste* spell effect on the user only. The user may then move at double normal speed and attack twice per round for 1 turn (similar to the 3rd level magic-user spell).
- **Translating.** The weapon that has this talent will, on command, enable the user to understand any and all languages heard. The ability lasts for 6 turns.
- **Watching.** The weapon with this talent may be commanded to watch for any one monster type or race. The weapon can then sense the presence of the creatures specified, and it will vibrate slightly if one or more of the named creatures come within 60' of it. The vibration will silently alert the user. A specific creature cannot be named, only a race or monster type, and the weapon can only sense one race or type per day, even if none are sensed.
- **Wishing.** This talent will grant 1d3 *wishes* to the user (identical to the 9th level magic-user spell).

## Artifacts

An *artifact* is a powerful magical item created by an Immortal (see Chapter 15) and imbued with his personal power. Each artifact is unique and should be individually designed by the DM.

Nothing regarding an artifact happens by chance, for the destiny of each is planned and controlled by the Immortals. Thus, they are only rarely encountered, most often by high-level characters on a path to Immortality. No mortal retains an artifact for long.

Artifacts are treated as 40th level for purposes of determining their magical effects. They are immune to most attacks, except those by other artifacts or weapons of at least +5 bonus; however, each can be destroyed by a legendary meth-

od that is unique to that artifact. *Wishes*, the most powerful mortal magic, have no effect on artifacts.

Using an artifact inflicts handicaps and penalties on the character. A *handicap* is a permanent effect that cannot be negated as long as the character has the artifact. It usually appears when a power of the artifact is first used. A *penalty* is a temporary disadvantage that can be offset by magic or time while the artifact is possessed.

Artifacts have four power levels: minor, lesser, greater, and major. These levels affect the number and strength of the artifact's powers, handicaps, and penalties, as in the Artifacts Table.

## Sample artifact

### MASK OF BACHRAEUS

(Minor artifact: Entropy, evil)

History: This mask was made by Bachraeus, an Immortal who became the patron of the medusae. The mask was to be worn by the high cleric of a secret cult that grew within the Milennian Empire and formed a dangerous alliance with the medusae. With the fall of that empire and the destruction of the cult, the mask was lost.

Description: A smooth, blue mask of a strange ceramic material; the features are stylized, possibly female or elvish. A wig of long, dark, leather strips is attached at the top and back.

Powers: The Mask of Bachraeus possesses the following powers:

- *Flesh to stone*, 120' range, one creature (gaze attack).
- *Charm person*, 120' range, one creature (gaze attack).
- *Detect magic*, 60' range.
- *Pass-wall*, 60' range, 6-turn duration, 5' opening up to 10' deep.
- Wearer is immune to *turn to stone* and *charm* attacks, except his own reflected gaze.
- Wearer is immune to poisons from living creatures.

Handicap: When the mask is put on, the wearer's Charisma is reduced to 4 (see Notes). The mask cannot be removed or disguised while the wearer lives.

Penalty: Successful use of *detect magic* or *flesh to stone* reduces the wearer's own Strength by 1 for one hour. The successful use of any other power reduces the wearer's own Strength by 2. If the wearer's own Strength is reduced to 0, he dies.

Notes: This artifact is evilly enchanted and can be detected as such. The wearer loses 1 point of Charisma immediately when the mask is put on, then more at the rate of 1 point per week until a Charisma of 4 is reached. The mask, meanwhile,

will become progressively uglier and more evil-looking. The use of any power by the wearer is voluntary. If the wearer dies, he and his equipment turn to stone with the exception of this artifact. This artifact will shatter irrevocably if its gaze is ever reflected by the Golden Mirror of Ka. The wearer of the mask will be immediately stunned for a full turn and will remember nothing of what he did while wearing the mask, but he will be otherwise unharmed.

## Cashing Treasure

At the end of each adventure, characters earn experience points based on the actual value of all treasures found and kept. However, they might lose some of the value of gems and jewelry in the process of exchanging such items for coin.

Though gems and jewelry are easy to carry, they are also hard to convert to spendable money. Most specialists and mercenaries will accept gems as payment, but they do not normally "give change" for overpayment, nor do they accept jewelry (as it is easily damaged). For most expenses (such as normal equipment purchases, construction costs, etc.) coin must be used.

Pieces of jewelry can usually be broken up into its gems, metal, etc. The whole piece is worth more than the individual parts, however; up to half of the value may be lost by divvying it into parts.

Any town or city will have a businessman (jeweler, moneychanger, collector of rare items, or even the town treasurer) who will exchange coins for gems and jewelry, and probably vice versa. For gems, a fee of 1%-5% of the value is charged. Jewelry is harder to sell, and a 2%-12% fee may be charged. Small towns have less cash on hand and may be unable to buy expensive jewels or gems. As a general guideline, the population of the town is equal to the largest value of item it can convert to coin in gp (for example, a city of 10,000 could handle gems or jewelry of up to 10,000 gp value).

A businessperson may always refuse to "cash" an item for various reasons (lack of ready coin, suspicion of stolen merchandise, suspected magical origin, and so forth). If a businessperson refuses the transaction, a wealthy private individual might be found to buy the item. The amount offered will be 20%-80% (2d4 x 10) of the stated value, and a jeweler is usually consulted to appraise the item.

Unlike gems and jewelry, special objects (such as the objects in the "Special Treasure" section, earlier this chapter) must be sold *before* any XP award is given. The prices given on the Special Treasure Value Table (page 227) are approximately what the items will bring in markets trad-

# Chapter 16: Treasure

ing in these goods. The prices are unlikely to be higher except where the items are scarce and there is a demand for them. In fact, prices may be lower if the goods are in common supply.

## Buying and Selling Magical Items

At some point in the game, the characters will probably find a magical item that they cannot use or do not want. Such items are generally traded to NPCs for favors; however, characters may try to sell the item for cash.

Generally, magical items can be sold between characters—PCs and NPCs—but the seller must personally find a buyer through advertising, approaching wealthy patrons, etc. If the DM would like to use another method for settling this matter, his or her wishes should be followed.

## Making Magical Items

At higher experience levels, magic-users and clerics can create magical items. Most characters who create magical items are magic-users. When a cleric is trying to create magical items, substitute his Wisdom for the magic-user's Intelligence when using the methods in this section.

To create any magical item, the character must be at least 9th level. Some magical items will require that the character be of higher level.

A number of factors need to be considered when making magical items, including spell effects, specialists of skills needed, spell components, and the chance of success. These factors are defined in the following text.

### Spell Effects

The spellcaster must know a spell relating to the magical effect that he wants the object to have. For example, if he is trying to make a *fly carpet*, he must know the *fly* spell. If he doesn't know the spell, he can't enchant an item with a similar effect.

### Specialists or Skills

The spellcaster must hire and work with a specialist who can make the type of physical object to be enchanted (for example, an armorer if the item is to be a sword or a weaver if the item is to be a carpet); alternatively, if the optional general skills rules are being used, the spellcaster must know the general skill pertaining to the making of the object or hire a craftsman who does.

To create a magical item, the spellcaster and the specialist must work together while the item is being created; a spellcaster cannot, for instance, magically enchant a normal sword once the sword has already been made. The specialist's fees are contained in the costs listed below for creating a magical item.

### Spell Components

For every spell with which a spellcaster is trying to enchant an object, he must find some sort of rare element or component (typically involving a long or difficult adventure). The DM determines exactly what that component is and tells the player. For example, a magic-user trying to make a *fly carpet* might have to find a rare silkworm (in a monster-haunted land) or acquire a certain purple dye (which can only be processed from the bodies

![Illustration of a spellcaster, wearing a helmet and armor, kneeling over a skeleton and other magical items, including a large skull and a small device on a shelf.]()![](_page_249_Picture_16.jpeg)

of giant crustacean sea-monsters).

On such an adventure, the spellcaster might acquire enough quantities of the rare component to create several such magical items. That's all right, within reason. But if he comes back with a 1,000 gallons of giant snail dye and wants to use it to create *fly carpets* from now until eternity, the dye will inevitably spoil, be destroyed, or be stolen by a rival magic-user—meaning that the character will eventually have to go adventuring again to acquire more of the component if he really wants to make more than one of the same magical item.

A spellcaster might acquire a lot of a rare material and then try to spread the excess around, trading it to fellow magicians for their excess rare materials. This isn't so good. The DM can simply say that doesn't work—the materials have to be acquired and processed by the spellcaster himself, or the DM can say the spellcaster isn't familiar enough with the materials to rely on them. Alternatively, the DM can say this is all right—but the spellcaster's subsequent project will always require at least *one* rare component that he must travel forth and acquire himself.

### Chance of Success

When a character tries to create a specific type of magical item, he may fail. His chance for success is rolled on d100, using the character's Intelligence (Wisdom if a cleric), his current level, and the level of the spell involved (or the number of armor or weapon bonuses or penalties); all other numbers in the formula are the same for each use. The formula is as follows.

$$([ ext{Int} + ext{Lvl}] imes 2) - (3 imes ext{spell level}) = ext{\%}$$

For example, a 10th level wizard with Intelligence 18 tries to make a *wand offireballs*, which uses a 3rd level spell. His chance for success, using the formula above, is as follows.

$$([18 + 10] imes 2) - (3 imes 3) = 47 ext{\%} ext{ on d100}$$

If the character rolls that number or less on d100, he has succeeded in enchanting the item. If he fails to roll the number, the character has used up all the gold pieces, time, and materials he has acquired. He must attain all the things he has lost, attempt to create the item, and roll again the next time he tries to see if he has succeeded.

## The Process of Enchantment

Once all the spells are determined and all the rare components are assembled, the process of enchantment may begin. Since this process varies for making magical items, the following text has been divided into two sections, one on armor and weapons and the other on miscellaneous items.

Of course, should characters find the magical items they are trying to create for sale on the market, they are free to buy the item—but the price will typically be *twice* that of the cost of enchanting and constructing the same item. This is reflected in a number of factors, including the cost of advertising the item, storing it until sale, sentimental value, and—naturally—a profit for the maker.

Finally, a DM may have some characters who wish to construct magical items for sale and not

for private use. The DM should note all the time requirements, prohibitive costs (both of which take away from the character's opportunity to adventure), and the need for rare components. If the character still persists in pursuing his new-found profession of magical item-maker, rigorously enforce the rules.

## Armor and Weapons

The procedure for bestowing bonuses (either pluses or minuses) on armor and weapon items is different than for miscellaneous magical items. Remember that the chance of success is rolled only once, regardless of the number of bonuses or penalties the armor or weapon has. As with miscellaneous items, the spellcaster must first find the item's *initial enchantment cost*. This figure is the cost in gp for materials that are used in the creation of the magical item.

The initial enchantment cost makes a +1 bonus or —1 penalty, according to the spellcaster's choice. For each subsequent plus or minus for either armor or weapons, multiply the initial enchantment cost by the number of bonuses or penalties. (For example, the two-handed *sword* +1 from the example in the Armor and Weapons Initial Enchantment Checklist would cost 22,500 gp if made into a *sword* +3.)

If desired, armor and weapons can be created with additional spell effects—these are figured at the corresponding effect's spell level and cost 1,000 gp per spell level. See below for more information on adding bonuses. Note that magical armor and weapons *cannot* be recharged, as can certain magical items.

To find the initial enchantment cost of magical armor or weapons, multiply the item's normal (nonmagical) price (gp) by its encumbrance (cn). For armor, divide this result by 3; for weapons, multiply it by 5. Always round the result up to the next 10th. This final result is the initial enchantment cost, as outlined in the Armor and Weapons Initial Enchantment Cost Checklist.

### Armor and Weapons Initial Enchantment Cost Checklist

**Armor:** (nonmagical price [gp] x enc [cn]) / 3  
**Weapons:** (nonmagical price [gp] x enc [cn]) X 5

**Examples:** A chain mail hauberk normally costs 40 gp and weighs 400 cn. Its initial enchantment cost is 40 x 400 / 3, or 5,333 gp. A two-handed nonmagical sword costs 15 gp and weighs 100 cn. Its initial enchantment cost is 15 x 100 x 5, or 7,500 gp.

**Note:** The minimum initial enchantment cost may be no less than 3,000 gp for armor (including shields) or 100 gp for weapons. All armor and weapon enchantments are limited to + / - 5, maximum. Characters cannot make a + / - 6 or greater piece of armor or weapon.

### Adding Bonuses vs. Opponents

If the DM wishes to give a weapon a bonus (or penalty) against a special opponent, simply add the extra bonuses to the original enchantment costs, but at *half price*. For example, a *sword* +1,

+3 vs. *undead* counts as a *sword* +2 for the purpose of calculating the initial enchantment cost (the base +1, applicable to all targets, counts as a +1; the additional +2 bonus vs. undead, cumulative with the base bonus, counts at half price for another +1). Initial enchantment cost for a *sword* +1 is 3,000 gp [nonmagical price 10 gp x 60 cn enc x 5 = 3,000 gp]; to get a *sword* +1, +3 vs. *undead*, would cost 6,000 gp (3,000 x 2).

Magical powers targeted exclusively toward special opponents cost less to make, however. The cost of these limited extra magical effects is reduced 10% per restriction. One restriction would be a class of monsters; a second would be a species of monsters; a third would be a specific, named monster.

**Example:** A *sword* +2 with a *charm dryads* power would cost as follows.

**Initial enchantment cost for *sword* +1:**  
3,000 gp [(10 gp x 60 cn enc] x 5 = 3,000 gp). The +2 bonus means initial enchantment cost is doubled. Total cost for magical *sword* +2: 6,000 gp.

**Spell effect cost, the *charm dryads* effect:**  
4,000 gp. *Charm monster* is a 4th level spell, and spell effects cost 1,000 gp per spell level. Permanency is +20,000 gp (5 x 4,000 gp, the spell effect cost). Basic spell effect cost is 24,000 gp, -20% (from two restrictions: humanoid class and species dryad). Total cost for spell effect *charm dryads*: 19,200 gp.

**Total weapon cost:** 25,200 gp. *Sword* +2 (6,000 gp) + *charm dryads* effect (19,200 gp) = 25,200 gp.

**Creation time:** 32 days. One week plus one day per each 1,000 gp additional costs, indicating 25.2 extra days.

### Adding Magical Powers

Extra magical effects can be added to armor and weapons. Weapon talents, sword primary and extraordinary powers, and armor special powers are considered spell effects; find the spell that corresponds most closely to the talent or power and enchant the weapon with that.

The creator must roll a chance of success for each spell effect added. Each successful roll indicates the item gains the power rolled for. A failure means that the corresponding effect is lost and that no more enchantments may be added (earlier, successful enchantments, if any, are not lost).

In other words, if the first roll fails, the whole item is ruined, the gp spent, and the time lost. If the first roll is a success but the second one fails, then the first spell effect has been enchanted on the item, but the second was a failure, and no new effects may be added. But at least the item survived the initial enchantment and is magical.

Note that the extra cost of an additional power is added to the total armor or weapon cost, not the item's original initial enchantment cost). The enchantment process takes an extra day per 1,000 gp added to the total cost of the weapon beyond the initial process time.

**Example:** A 20th level, 18 Intelligence spellcaster wants to make a *shield* +2 that has the special power of *charm person*. The initial enchantment cost (as noted in the Armor and

Weapons Initial Enchantment Cost Checklist, above) is calculated as follows: nonmagical cost (10 gp) x enc (100 cn) / 3 = 333 gp, which is rounded up to 340 gp and then doubled because the shield has two bonuses, for 680 gp. However, checking the checklist above, there is the note stating that the minimum initial enchantment cost of any armor (including shields) is 3,000 gp. Therefore, this *shield* +2, *charm person* has an initial enchantment cost of 3,000 gp.

The *charm person* effect is a 1st level spell, so that adds another 1,000 gp (the cost of a 1st level spell effect). The total cost of this shield is 4,000 gp.

The spellcaster must roll two times for chance of success: once for the initial enchantment (the +2 bonus), and a second time for the *charm person* spell effect. Using the chance of success formula,  $( ext{Int} + ext{LvI}) ext{ X } 2) - (3 ext{ x spell level}) = ext{%}$ , this spellcaster's percentage chance is 73% for each chance, as follows:

$$(18 + 20) ext{ x } 2) - (3 ext{ x 1st level}) = 73%$$

### Enchantment Time

Enchantment time for armor and weapons is the same as for magical items: one week plus one day for each 1,000 gp (rounded up) spent on the armor or weapon.

During this time, the spellcaster must be working steadily in his workshop—eight hours per day. (More hours spent per day won't speed up the enchantment process; magic materials need time to absorb magical spells. Fewer hours spent per day, however, will slow the process considerably.)

Generally the spellcaster cannot be adventuring during this time. If he takes a one- or two-day break from the enchantment process, it will slow the process down by a day or two. If the spellcaster takes more than two days off, however, the enchantment is spoiled; the armor or weapon is ruined and cannot be enchanted. The spellcaster has lost all the gp the item cost and must start over again.

### Intelligent Swords

Only Immortals create intelligent swords. However, there is the possibility that an Immortal will make intelligent any sword being created. Whenever a character is creating a magical sword, the DM should determine, in secret, if an Immortal has made the sword intelligent. The maker of the sword will not know whether or not this has happened until well after the sword is in the hands of its eventual owner. The Immortal's actions do not change the cost of the weapon.

### Special Materials (Optional)

The DM can allow the spellcaster's choice of materials to affect his chance of success. Precious gems, metals, or materials could retain magical powers better than rough wood or common stones. The can modify the chance of success as he or she sees fit.

# Chapter 16: Treasure

## Magical Armor and Weapons Costs

**Armor initial enchantment cost:** (non-magical price [gp] x enc [cn]) / 3

**Weapon initial enchantment cost:** (non-magical price [gp] x enc [cn]) X 5

**Number of bonuses cost:** Initial enchantment cost (either armor or weapons) x the number of additional bonuses or penalties (pluses or minuses)

**Bonuses against opponents cost:** 1/2 the initial enchantment cost X number of bonuses against opponent (if used)

**Restriction cost:** -10% per bonus against opponent per restriction (if used)

**Total initial enchantment cost:** Initial enchantment cost + number of bonuses cost + bonuses against opponents cost—restriction cost

**Spell effect cost:** 1,000 gp x number of spell levels per spell effect

**Permanency cost:** 5 x spell effect cost

**Restriction cost:** -10% per spell effect against opponent per restriction (if used)

**Total spell effect cost:** Spell effect cost + permanency cost + restriction cost

**Total Magical Armor or Weapon Cost:** Total initial enchantment cost + total spell effect cost

**Examples:** A magic-user wishes to create a *wand of polymorph others*. This is a 4th level spell and is the only spell on the wand, so his initial enchantment cost is 4,000 gp (4 x 1,000 gp = 4,000 gp). Now, he wants to charge it by giving it 25 charges. The cost is 10,000 gp (10% of the initial enchantment cost [400 gp] x number of charges [25] = 10,000 gp). Total cost of the wand: 14,000 gp.

Another magic-user wants to create a *ring of lore* with no other spell effects. This is a 7th level spell, so the initial enchantment cost is 7,000 gp. She wants to make it permanent; the cost is 5 x 7,000 gp, or 35,000 gp. Total cost of the ring: 42,000 gp.

## Multiple Enchantments

If an item has several separate spell effects, the creator must roll a chance for success for each spell. Each successful roll indicates the item gains the power rolled for. A failure means that the corresponding effect is lost and that no more enchantments may be added (earlier, successful enchantments, if any, are not lost).

In other words, if the first roll fails, the whole item is ruined, the gp spent, and the time lost. If the first roll is a success but the second one fails, then the first spell effect has been enchanted on the item, but the second was a failure, and no new effects may be added. But at least the item survived the initial enchantment and is magical.

**Example:** A 20th level, 18 Intelligence wizard makes a *crystal ball with ESP*. That requires two spell effects—*clairvoyance* and *ESP*. The initial enchantment cost is 5,000 gp (one is a 3rd level spell and the other is 2nd level; 1,000 gp x total number of spell levels). The wizard must roll for chance of success for both spells.

She tries for the *clairvoyance* effect first, as it's the main component of a *crystal ball*. The formula for the chance of success is  $( ext{[Int} + ext{Lvl}} 2) imes (3 ext{ X spell level}) = ext{%}$ . Her chance is  $( ext{[18} + 20] imes 2) imes (3 ext{ X 3}) = 67 ext{%}$ .

Next she tries for the *ESP* effect. Her chance is  $( ext{[18} + 20] imes 2) imes (3 ext{ X 2}) = 72 ext{%}$ .

If she makes both chances, she has a *crystal ball with ESP*. If she makes the first chance but fails the second, she has a plain *crystal ball*. If she fails the first chance, she has a spherical lump of crystal that can never be enchanted again.

Whether she succeeds fully, partially, or not at all, though, she loses the rest of the costs for the *crystal ball*. For instance, this item is permanent and not a charged item, so she will lose 25,000 gp more (5 x 5,000 gp [initial enchantment cost] = 25,000 gp). Her total cost, succeed or fail, is 30,000 gp.

## Uses Per Day

Some permanent magical items may only be usable a certain number of times within a given time length. When creating a magical item with that sort of limitation on it, the DM reduces the initial enchantment cost by 20% for items that can be used once an hour, by 25% for items used once a day, by 30% for once a week, by 35% for once a month, etc. Then the DM can add the

cost of 30 charges plus one per use during the chosen time frame.

**Example:** A *wand of fireballs* usable twice per day is constructed as follows.

**Initial enchantment cost:** 2,250 gp (3,000 gp - 25%).

**Cost for charges:** 7,200 gp (2,250 x 10% x 32 charges).

**Total Cost:** 9,450 gp.

## Spells of Variable Power Levels

Some spells differ in power with the level of the caster—spells such as *fireballs* are especially dramatic examples. When creating magical items, magic-users must conform to the ordinary limits of the examples of such items already found in the D&D game. Wands can do only 6 dice of damage; staves can do only 8 dice of damage; rings and many types of miscellaneous magical items cannot be enchanted with damage-type spells.

When in doubt, find an example in the treasure listings earlier in this chapter that most closely resembles the treasure to be created and use that as a limitation for a PC or NPC who wants to create magic. Also, when beginning to create magical items, become familiar with the *dispel magic* spell description (in Chapter 3). It describes what happens to permanent items when struck with *dispel magic* spells.

## Recharging Items

The cost of recharging items is equal to the original cost of charges—that is, 10% of the initial enchantment cost x the number of charges = the cost to recharge. Items with charges can't be recharged beyond the original number of charges they had when they were created.

Potions and scrolls are items with charges, but they have but one charge per dose of potion or spell per scroll. (According to ancient tradition, each potion vial will contain only one charge of potion, while some scrolls can be enchanted with more than one spell.) Note that different spells on one scroll are considered separate magical items.

A wizard may decide at the moment of creation that an item with charges is nonrechargeable. In this case, reduce the initial enchantment cost by 20%. Once the item's charges are used up, the item ceases to be magical and can never be recharged.

## Enchantment Time

Magical items take a certain amount of time to create: one week plus one day for each 1,000 gp (rounded up) spent on the item.

For the examples above, the *wand of polymorph others* would take 31 days—one week plus 14 more days (for the 14,000 gp total). The *ring of lore* would take 49 days—one week plus 42 days (for the 42,000 gp).

The restrictions on a magic-user's time for making magical items are the same as for making magical armor and weapons. See "Enchantment Time" in the previous section for more details.

## Limits on Magical Item Creation

The DM can forbid a player to create any item that may unbalance a campaign. One type of magical item that can critically unbalance a cam-

## Miscellaneous Magical Items

To create a miscellaneous magical item, the DM must first find the item's initial enchantment cost. Follow the steps outlined in the Miscellaneous Magical Item Enchantment Cost Checklist to do so.

### Miscellaneous Magical Item Enchantment Cost Checklist

1. The spellcaster determines which spells will be cast on the magical item.
2. The spellcaster calculates the number of total number of spell levels
3. The spellcaster multiplies the number from Step 2 by 1,000 to determine the cost in gp for materials used in the creation of the magical item.

When the spellcaster has collected his rare materials, paid his initial enchantment cost, made his chance of success roll (per spell added), and gone through the necessary rituals, he has an energized item that is ready to be given its final enchantment.

To finish the job, the spellcaster must spend more gp and effort on the item. First, he must decide if the item is based on *charges* or is a *permanent* item. Items based on charges (such as wands, staves, potions, and scrolls) are eventually used up, though some are rechargeable. Items that are permanent can be used again and again and are never used up.

The cost for an item to have charges is 10% of the initial enchantment cost x the number of charges to be given to the item. The cost for an item to be permanent is 5 x the initial enchantment cost. (This is the same cost as if the item had 50 charges.)

paign is a wand or staff, especially if of a damaging spell, made permanent instead of with charges (so one can fire spells with it continuously).

Damaging and killing effects should always be limited, either by applying charges or by limiting uses.

## Making Magical Constructs

Constructs (magical monsters such as golems and gargoyle) are created much as magical treasures are. For some of the steps listed in this section the DM can refer to the previous section on "Making Magical Items."

Where the text refers to magic-users' chances based on Intelligence, substitute a cleric's Wisdom as appropriate. The spellcaster creating the construct must be of 18th experience level or a level equal to the HD of the construct being created, whichever is *greater*. If the construct has more than 36 HD, the DM can either refuse to allow the character to create it or can limit its creation to 36th level characters only.

If the construct is to have up to two special abilities (that is, from zero to two abilities), the magic-user must have the *create magical monsters* spell. (A cleric can use a *wish* spell for this purpose instead.)

If the construct is to have any special abilities that would give it three or more asterisks, the magic-user must have the *create any monster* spell instead. A cleric cannot create a construct of this power level.

For information on finding rare components, see "Spell Components" under "Making Magical Items," above.

## Costs and Time

Construct cost: 2,000 gp per HD + 5,000 gp per asterisk (as noted in the monster descriptions in Chapter 14).

Once a spellcaster has acquired the rare component, he can begin work on a construct, but he will have to spend a lot of money. The construct cost includes money that goes toward buying the basic materials that make up the

construct and buying special, rare, expensive materials that aid in its enchantment.

Constructs, however, only take the same amount of time to create as do other magical items: One week plus one day per 1,000 gp of cost. Like the magical items, constructs are also subject to the same time constrictions, as noted in "Enchantment Time" in the section above on making magical items.

## Chance of Success

Once the spellcaster has expended the necessary time and gp on a construct, he can roll to see if the enchantment is a success. His chance of success is somewhat different from the chance for making magical items; it is as follows:

$$[(\text{Int} + \text{Lvl}) \times 2] - (\text{HD} + \text{number of asterisks}) = \%$$

Example: A Wisdom 18, 20th level cleric wants to create a bronze golem (20 HD, 2 asterisks). She's already gone on her quest to find the essential components, spent 50,000 gp on materials, and spent 57 days in the enchantment process. Now it's time for her to check her chance of success. Her chance is  $(18+20) \times 2] - (20+2) = 54\%$ .

If the roll fails, then the enchantment fails, too. The cleric loses all the time, effort, and money she has expended.

## Existing vs. New Constructs

When the player wants to create a construct

![Illustration of a large, ancient stone castle or fortress with a tall tower, set in a landscape with trees and birds flying. A figure, possibly a wizard or spellcaster, is shown in the foreground, casting a spell or performing a ritual.]()![](_page_252_Picture_23.jpeg)

from Chapter 14, look up the abilities of that monster. If the player wants to create an all-new kind of construct, the DM must decide whether to allow this.

If so, the player designs the construct according to the monster statistics format in Chapter 14. The DM then decides whether the construct is possible by looking over the construct's statistics and abilities. If they are significantly better than those of existing constructs that are at similar HD values, then the player should tone them down until they correspond more to the abilities of existing constructs.

#### New Construct Guidelines

There are some basic guidelines for creating new constructs, as outlined in the following text.

**Hit Dice:** A lesser construct can have from 1 to 6 HD; a greater construct can have from 1 to 36.

**Immunities:** Lesser constructs (such as living statues) are immune to poison; gases; *charm*, *sleep*, and other mind-affecting and illusion spells. However, they can be harmed by normal weapons. This set of immunities is worth one asterisk (\*). Greater constructs (such as golems) are additionally immune to attacks from non-magical weapons. This is worth another asterisk. Some constructs have extra, individual immunities (such as to cold, to fire, etc.), but these vary from construct to construct. Each individual immunity (or group of related immunities, at the DM's discretion) is worth another asterisk, which increases its cost.

**Healing:** Constructs do not heal normally; they must be healed by magic. Unless otherwise

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_253_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 16: Treasure

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_253_Picture_2.jpeg)

stated, a construct can be healed by any spell that heals humans and demihumans. However, the DM can substitute another spell that heals a specific type of construct (for example, a construct that is a mechanical monstrosity might be "healed" by a *lightning bolt*, recovering hit points equal to the damage theoretically inflicted by the spell; it would be immune to that spell in combat, but it would not be healed by ordinary healing magic).

**Number of Attacks:** A construct can have anywhere from one to four attacks in a round, as the DM decides.

**Damage:** A construct, in any combat round, can do no more damage in combat than *three times its HD in hit points*, and it's not inappropriate to limit that damage to twice its HD in hit points. That damage represents the maximum possible damage the construct could roll, and the damage should be divided among all its attacks. For example, let's say that a sand golem invented by a player has 10 HD and three attacks per round. Therefore, it could not possibly do more than 30 hit points of damage per round. Divided among three attacks, that's a maximum of 10 hit points per attack. At maximum, the sand golem could do  $10 \times 3 = 30$  points of damage per attack. The DM might prefer for it to do  $10 \times 3$  instead, depending on how powerful the sand golem is.

**Reproduction:** Constructs do not reproduce; there are never "baby gargoyle," for example. For each construct a spellcaster wants to create, he will have to repeat the creation process at the same costs, length of time, and chance of success.

**Special Attacks:** Some constructs have special, unusual attacks (such as poison-gas breath or crushing hags). The DM can approve, veto, or modify any special attack chosen by the player creating the construct. Each special attack is worth another asterisk (\*) and, as always, each asterisk increases the construct's cost).

## Making Huge Magical Items

Some mighty spellcasters can create buildings and vessels that move by magic. If the DM wants such things in a campaign, allow the spellcaster player characters to create them.

These things cost a lot of money to make, and many of the ones created by NPCs are some wizard's whimsical idea translated into reality—meaning that they often have little practical usefulness and cost entire fortunes. (For instance, a mansion that rolls around on wheels.)

Spellcasters making such things must be of 18th level or higher.

Spellcasters building such things must employ specialists who can create the normal object being enchanted. For instance, a spellcaster making a flying ship must employ an NPC specialist ship-builder. In campaigns that use the optional general skills rules, the spellcaster himself may know the skill pertaining to the object in question; regardless, he or someone working with him must know the appropriate skill (which is usually Engineering or Shipbuilding).

The overseeing engineer or shipwright will have to make his Intelligence ability skill (or skill roll) three times per each day of construction. Three failures in the same day means that he has failed to notice an engineering flaw that will ul-

timately doom the magical item. However, the flaw may not be revealed until well after the object begins to see steady use (for instance, in the case of a vessel not until well into the craft's maiden voyage or even after), so the DM should make these rolls for the character, not letting him know when he has failed. For this reason, it's often a good idea for a builder to have two or three such experts on hand, so they can spot one another's mistakes.

## The Frame

The entire *frame* of the construction will have to be enchanted. On a ship, the frame consists of the hull, topdeck, and masts. On a building, the frame consists of all exterior walls and an area of flooring at least as large as the building or complex. The walls may be of wood, stone, or metal; the flooring must be of stone or metal.

The frame must be created through the use of spells that create permanent, nondispellable physical objects—these spells, listed in Chapter 3, include *wood form*, *stone form*, etc. Normal building techniques can't make a structure strong enough to stand up to regular moving, so the magic-user must use spells. Interior partitions, such as the floors of a building or interior decks of a ship, may be constructed in the non-magical fashion.

Most of these mighty magical items are created by magic-users instead of clerics. To fashion something like this, a cleric would have to know and freely employ the *wish* spell as a substitute for each of the creation spells necessary for this task.

## The Process of Building

The player character designs the floor plans of the building or ship he plans to build. He and the DM must then determine how many applications of *clothform*, *woodform*, *stoneform*, *ironform*, and *steelform* spells must go into making the craft's frame.

When the builders decide to construct the craft, they must enchant each one of the individual forming spells that goes into the frame with *every spell that is to apply to the entire craft*.

For instance, a character wants to create a metal boat that will carry its passengers beneath the waves without drowning them. The craft is 60' long and some 12' in diameter. It is to be built of steel, with four large, thick windows in strategic locations (bow, bow deck, stern, and amidships top).

The player and DM determine that it will take 2,262 square feet of steel to make the hull. (That's 12' diameter x pi x 60' length.) Since each *steelform* spell creates 500 square feet of steel, the hull will take five *steelform* spells to construct. Since it's to have four large windows, it will additionally take four *stoneform* spells, which will *not* be cast to create objects of the maximum possible size allowed by the spell but instead will be used to cast individual windows.

Now, each *steelform* and *stoneform* spell must have the following enchantments made on it: create *air* and *fly*. Here, the DM is creatively allowing the player to interpret *fly* as an underwater spell instead—it will not lift the vessel above the waves, only to the surface, but the spell will allow the ship to move at 360°/turn underwater.

With these spells, the vessel can cruise around

on top of or beneath the water, and fresh air will be supplied to its passengers.

Naturally, holes will be left in the frame as it's being magically constructed, and airtight doors built magically or by normal means will be fitted there afterward. The doors do not have to be enchanted with these spells.

Now, the spells cast on one section of *stoneform*, *ironform*, etc. count as multiple spells for that section only. If a character botches a success roll when casting the enchantment, that section is spoiled—but since it is still under construction, it may be magically removed and a new one started. It just costs more that way. . . .

## Speed of Construction

Speed of magical construction depends on how many spellcasters will work on it. Calculate how many different spells of which type need to go into the making of the frame. Determine how many spells of the proper types the participating spellcasters can cast. Compare the two sets of figures and figure out how fast the project will come together.

## Walls and Floors

As mentioned before, the interior walls and floors may be created by magical or normal means.

If the builder-organizer is using normal means, he pays the workmen as per the rates given on (or extrapolated from) the charts in Chapter 12.

If the builder-organizer is using magic to finish the walls and floors, he and his crew use the spells already described to do the job. The time required is the same as for enchantment of the frame; it depends on the number of spellcasters and the size of the job.

Individual walls and other partitions may have enchantments cast upon them. For instance, a room such as a library might have an individual *continual light* cast on it so that it will never be dark.

## Finishing Details

Rules for creating other magical items associated with the craft are the same as for creating miscellaneous magical items. In the example of the submersible vessel, for instance, a battery of *wands of magical missiles* might be set up in the bow to act as torpedoes. Such details, which do not affect the entire magical construction, should be created as individual small magical items and simply mounted where they're to be used. Objects (like the vehicular *wand of magical missiles*) can be attached to the exterior of a magical vehicle with controls in the interior at no extra cost or difficulty.

### Enchantment Costs

*Frame enchantment cost:* Total number of spell levels x 3,000 gp

*Extra items enchantment cost:* Same as for creating miscellaneous magic

If a cleric is creating an object with the use of *wish* spells, then calculate the number of spell levels according to the spells being simulated,

not according to the level of the *wish* spell.

A builder of a home or vessel might hire spellcasters to do the job for him. If he does, he pays not only the amount dictated by the project, but also the salaries of the spellcaster hirelings. Check Chapter 12 for more information.

## Dispel Magic Attacks

It may be that a vessel built with these rules will be hit with a *dispel magic* spell while traveling. What then? First, the vessel's entire frame must fit within the  $20' \times 20' \times 20'$  area affected by the spell. If it does not, the *dispel magic* has no effect on the vessel. If it does, the *dispel magic* is checked against it.

Assuming it does succeed, all affected spells "go down" (that is, stop working). Those that are not permanent enchantments are completely dispelled; those that are permanent enchantments only go down for 1d10 (1-10) rounds.

A flying vessel would begin to drop and would continue to do so until the *fly* spell returned. In the submersible, the vessel would stop moving (and begin to sink slowly), and the air would slowly begin to go stale until the *create air* spell returned (unless it was topside, in which case the operators could open a hatch for fresh air).

With flying vessels, this situation could result in a crash. (See the rules for falling damage in Chapter 8 to calculate damage sustained.) In a fall, a vessel takes the full damage listed, and every individual section of the frame and every passenger, crewman, or piece of cargo will take that damage.

If, however, "power" starts back up again before the vessel has crashed or if the passengers can save themselves with a *wish*, the vessel and its precious cargo will not hit the ground.

## Spell Research

A cleric, magic-user, elf, or druid—even a paladin or an avenger in rare instances—can try to invent new spells and create new magical items through research. These are difficult and lengthy projects. For clerics and druids, substitute the Wisdom scores for Intelligence scores in the procedures that follow.

## Player Procedures

When a player wishes for his spellcasting character to create a new spell, he first informs his DM of his desire. Then, following the format shown in Chapter 3, he writes up his spell as he envisions it working. He does not indicate its spell level.

The DM then evaluates the spell as it is written up, indicates which spell level he or she thinks it should be, and suggests any changes that the player must make to the spell write-up. If the spell level chosen is higher than the highest level spell the spellcasting character can have, the character cannot yet research and develop the spell; he must either limit it further, until the DM adjusts the spell level down to that which the character could cast, or wait until the character is of the appropriate level to cast the spell he is creating.

When the player and the DM are satisfied with the result, go to the following procedure.

## Character Procedures

Spell research requires research materials, components, time, and money. Once these requirements are met, the character can roll for his chance of success.

### Research

To research a spell, a spellcaster must first have access to a large library such as those that exist in major cities or those that are in the possession of powerful wizards or clerics.

The DM will have to decide whether a player character's library is sufficient to the task—usually it isn't until the spellcaster is at least 18th level or is at least 9th level and has rigorously acquired every spell book and magical research volume possible throughout his career. If the PC's library isn't adequate, he'll have to get permission from a school of magic, clerical order, or powerful wizard or cleric in order to use a greater library.

### Components

The spellcaster must then find components for the development of the spell. These are up to the DM to determine; on the average, the component must come from a monster with HD at least equal to the spell level (or of similar difficulty to attain), and the monster must have some appropriate relationship to the magic spell being developed. For example, red dragon scales would be appropriate for an *explosive cloud*, fresh troll blood for a *regeneration*, etc.

The spellcaster must have these components in hand before beginning spell research, and he must go on an adventure to acquire them; he can't just buy them from a greater wizard or cleric. There are no limits to this process other than the DM's and players' imaginations.

### Time and Money

The spellcaster must then spend large amounts of gold during the progress of his research. The total cost of spell research comes to 1,000 gp x the spell level.

Research takes one week for the initial research, plus one day per 1,000 gp spent. At the end of this time, the DM will tell him to make his chance of success roll.

If the spellcaster runs out of gold before it's time for his chance of success roll, he may interrupt his research, leave on an adventure to earn more money, and come back later to resume his research; he loses his initial week of research (he'll have to spend another week to refamiliarize himself with his work), but he doesn't lose the money he's already spent; those gp are still counted toward research cost.

### Chances of Success

The chance of success to research a spell vary depending on the spell level researched and whether it is a new spell (not already appearing on the campaign world) or a common one (a spell that other spellcasters know, but which the PC hasn't been able to learn from them and so is developing independently).

For a common spell, add the magic-user's Intelligence score to his experience level and multiply the result by two. Then subtract 3 per spell level being researched.

For a new spell, follow the same procedure,

except subtract 5 per spell level instead of 3. Regardless of success chances, a roll of 95 or better is an automatic failure. There is no automatic success. The chance of success for researching spells is as follows:

Common spell:  $[(\text{Int} + \text{Lvl}) \times 2] - (3 \times \text{spell level}) = \%$ 

New spell:  $[(\text{Int} + \text{Lvl}) \times 2] - (5 \times \text{spell level}) = \%$ 

For example, a 5th level cleric with a 15 Wisdom researches a common 1st level spell. He has a  $(15 + 5) \times 2 - 3 = 37\%$  chance of success.

If the initial attempt is a failure, the character must start over. However, if he tries again, his next attempt will be at a  $+5\%$  chance of success. That  $+5\%$  is cumulative for each failure he has; for example, if he fails three times, on his fourth try he'll have  $+15\%$  to his chance.

## Dangers of Spell Research

The DM should be very careful when letting players develop new spells. Those that have permanent effects and those that increase in power with character level or have no saving throw can lead to massive imbalances in a campaign. A DM should severely limit or forbid any new spell that could cause such an imbalance.

In most cases, even with spells the DM approves, consider any new spell introduced to be "on probation." Test it in the campaign with the understanding that it may be changed should it prove hazardous to the campaign.

## Experience from Spells and Enchanted Items

At the DM's discretion, experience points can be awarded for creating enchanted items and magical vessels and for doing spell research—such work does, after all, represent a great investment in time, money, and effort, which is the essence of gaining experience. Note, however, that experience is only awarded for the first time a character works on a specific type of item.

When a character creates a magical item or piece of armor, he can get an XP award equal to the number of gp spent on the item—if the enchantment was successful. If the enchantment failed, he gets no experience from the project.

When a character creates an enchanted vessel, home, or similar huge magical item, he gets an XP award equal to  $1/3$  the gp spent on *successful* enchantments going into the making of the item. He gets nothing for failed enchantments.

For example, a team of magic-users working on a *flinging war galley* get the experience for the first galley they successfully create, but not on subsequent ones of the same class; they'd get experience for the first *flinging castle* they made, but not on subsequent ones of the same approximate size.

These XP awards are divided evenly among all spellcasters working on the enchanted item; this is especially important to remember for enchanted vessels, which generate a lot of XP but are usually worked upon by numerous spellcasters.

Characters do not get experience for spells that go into the making of the frame (such as *stoneform*) or from the nonmagical fittings added to such vehicles.

# Chapter 17: Campaigning

![Decorative border]()![](_page_255_Picture_2.jpeg)

![D&D logo]()![](_page_255_Picture_3.jpeg)

D&D® campaign is an organized framework which you, the Dungeon Master, create to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures. It should reflect the interests of both the DM and the players. The game has a physical setting (wilderness, dungeons, towns, etc.), but a campaign is much more than that, adding realistic details of all kinds—it's as detailed and interesting a world as you care to create and your players care to explore.

The campaign and the adventures within it are very similar to a series of fantasy novels. The characters are the heroes and heroines in these novels; focus the action on them. A campaign is only useful when it fulfills the purpose of the game. Fun. An inexperienced DM can easily become caught up in the creation of a gloriously detailed medieval empire, only to find that the players want something simple. You should talk with your players about their interests and create a fantasy world that entertains and satisfies both you and your players.

## Campaign Tone and Goals

### Campaign Tone

The campaign tone is the flavor of the campaign; it is an intangible element which gives the DM and players an understanding of how things are in the campaign, of what they can expect from their efforts.

For example, a campaign where the characters are all merry pirates, might have a tone of *swashbuckling adventure*. The players know that the tone of such a campaign is supposed to be similar to happy-go-lucky pirate movies. Therefore, they know that their characters can swing around on shroud-lines and do other acrobatic things without fear of looking like idiots—that if the characters behave like pirates do in these action films, they'll tend to be rewarded as those movie-pirates are.

In another example, a campaign where the characters are all spies working together in a world of espionage might have a tone of *deception and paranoia*. The players know that their characters can trust one another, but they can trust no one else, and must be suspicious of any person and any event they cross.

Decide on the campaign tone you want to have, and discuss your decision with your players. Some of them may be very uncomfortable or unhappy with your choice! For example, a player who likes light-hearted adventure might be very uncomfortable in the paranoid espionage campaign, while one who likes gritty realism might detest a swashbuckling-pirates tone.

### Campaign Goals

The campaign goal is one of the most important aspects of your D&D games. Goals give the players and the DM something to strive for, and provide all with a sense of reward and accomplishment once goals are completed. The best and longest-running D&D games are those that have definite objectives. Without a greater purpose, players quickly lapse into boredom.

A campaign goal is a very broad purpose, usually involving the fate of a nation or entire world and ties together all the adventures and happen-

ings in the campaign. This goal creates the major struggles of the world.

Your campaign goal might be "To bring peace to the world," or "To defeat the evil wizard who controls the sorcerous underground all across the continent," or some other great and noble purpose. The PCs might be a small but critical part of the action toward that goal, or might be major forces in the fight.

If a campaign goal is ever completed, there should follow a period of relative quiet, during which characters can pursue their personal goals and interests, before a new campaign goal is introduced.

The campaign goal can consist of several long-range, strategic goals. Each represents a step toward the overall goal, but is still very broad, reached after playing many adventures. Strategic goals might be "To free our continent of evil tribes," or "To unite the nations so they will aid us in our fight against evil."

Each strategic goal is comprised of many short-range, tactical goals. The goal of uniting the nations could be made up of tactical goals like "Befriending the good creatures of the Forbidden Forest," "Aiding the good people of Ylraum so as to oblige them to aid us in the future," and so forth.

The DM shouldn't force unwanted campaign goals on the players: The campaign would be no fun for the players who don't like the goals. Before the campaign starts (and once each campaign goal is concluded), sound the players out on the types of goals you'd like them to pursue in the future—be as general as possible to conceal important details and maintain a sense of mystery, but find out what your players like and don't like.

Be prepared to change goals as needed, for players can be amazingly unpredictable and inventive. All types of goals can change, as the players contribute their own ideas and preferences to the shape of the overall campaign. The final result is a unique blend of the DM's intentions and the players' imaginations, enjoyable by all.

Write the goals down. This helps to organize your thoughts, creates well-defined objectives, and develops a plan for your campaign.

In creating dungeons, wilderness encounters, and other game elements, always consider the various goals of the campaign. Design for a specific purpose. This is not to say that each and every game session must be a serious step toward a goal. Simple dungeon explorations are very entertaining on occasion, a release of frustrations and a welcome return to the basics of the game.

Having goals doesn't prohibit light-hearted adventuring. If humor is not well-represented in the game, the DM and players are taking the campaign much too seriously. Make jokes, toss out puns, and set up purely frivolous and ridiculous situations. Enjoy yourselves!

But, in the long run, adventures are far more satisfying, and more interesting, if there are well-defined goals to achieve.

### Player Character Goals

Just as campaigns have goals, so do characters, and a character's goals may have nothing to do with the campaign goals.

A character might desire to achieve personal power, to find and keep friends, to collect magical items, to find his or her ideal mate, to clear a stain of dishonor from the family name, to avenge a wrong done to the character before play began, etc.

Ask your players what their characters' goals are. If the players can't say, then the players need to do more thinking about their characters' personalities and histories *before they enter play*. Let your players come up with details about their characters' families and pre-campaign activities, even details which can modify the campaign history, and incorporate those details into your campaign world. (Don't give in to *unreasonable* details, such as "My father is the emperor and I'm rich enough to buy everything my companions want.")

Character goals can change just as campaign goals do; that's a natural process and you should not try to forestall it.

## Designing the Setting

The campaign world in which the player characters live and travel becomes a very important part of the game.

The historical setting upon which most D&D game campaigns are based is 15th century Europe—but a fantasy Europe where the printing press and gunpowder were never invented. The majority of adventures and supplements released by TSR take place in worlds like this, and so if you plan to utilize those resources to their fullest degree of usefulness, you'll want to create a similar setting.

On the other hand, if you're less concerned with the resources those adventures and supplements can offer you than with having a campaign world which reflects your personal views and imagination, you should make your setting anything you want it to be; perhaps you'll find useful characters, spells, equipment, and plots in those adventures and supplements anyway. You might want to use a good fantasy novel for your campaign's background, or you can make up all the details.

### Designing the Map

In designing the map of the campaign's main setting, you can follow these steps:

1. Decide on the Terrain
2. Draw Map(s) of the Area
3. Place the Home Town and Local Dungeons
4. Locate Areas Under Human Control
5. Locate Areas Under Nonhuman Control
6. Describe the Home Town
7. Fill in Other Details
8. Create Lairs and Encounter Tables

#### 1. Decide on the Terrain

Decide what the area will be like, overall. It may be mountainous, plains, woods, desert, or a combination of all. Naturally, the larger the area you plan to put on this map, the more types of terrain the map is likely to represent.

Your decision on what the campaign's all about helps dictate what sort of terrains are present. For example, if you're doing a campaign about desert nomads, most of your map will be made up of deserts, oases, and occasional

![Illustration showing a scene from a campaign, likely a battle or negotiation. A figure in elaborate armor is seated on a throne, gesturing, while another figure stands nearby holding a spear. A third figure is being restrained by two others. A fourth figure is looking on from the foreground.]()![](_page_256_Picture_1.jpeg)

villages and cities, perhaps bordered on all sides by the more congenial terrain of other nations. If you're doing a campaign about pirates, most of your map will be made up of oceans and seas, with lots of islands and coastlines delineated.

## 2. Draw Map(s) of the Area

Decide how large an area you want to show on your first map. This map can show a whole nation if you plan for your characters to wander in all directions from the start of the campaign; if you plan for your first several adventures to be in one area, such as a single valley, island, or barony, you can just draw that limited area at the campaign start and add on extra maps as they become necessary.

For wilderness maps, use hex paper. *You* can use an atlas to gather ideas about the way rivers, mountains, and other terrain features lie in relation to one another. Use common sense; rivers flow downhill, forests are rarely next to deserts, and jungles have many rivers and swamps.

If you're mapping a whole nation or a series of nations, your map scale should probably be 24 miles per hex. If you're making a big map of a small nation, or are mapping a smaller region, your map scale should probably be 8 miles per hex. You can adjust your map scale to suit the area you're mapping, but always indicate your scale on your map—just in case you forget.

Sketch the terrain in pencil first, so you can make changes; draw the one most noteworthy feature of a one-hex area in that hex. (For example, if there is a mighty city in that hex, use a symbol for a city; if the hex is predominantly forest, use a symbol for forest.) Though you only mark one ter-

rain type in each map hex, many features are assumed to be present in each hex and each type of terrain. For example, a jungle contains clearings, hills, valleys, swamps, and so forth—all represented on the map by a palm tree.

Make up terrain descriptions as needed during games, but don't try to make notes on everything you say. The players should keep records if they want details on wilderness areas. Keep only the information you need to remember for the campaign—cities, castles, important monster lairs, and so forth.

## 3. Place the Home Town and Local Dungeons

*You* might wish for all of the campaign's first player characters to come from the same village, town, or city, which we'll refer to here as the home town. Unless you're a skilled DM and know how to bring together characters from widely varied cities, we recommend this approach.

Choose the location of the PCs' home town on the map. This town should be near a river or road. If you place the town near the center of the map, the characters can explore in all directions.

If your campaign makes use of dungeons (described later), you can locate a dungeon near the home town—in a deserted or difficult-to-reach area such as mountains or deep forest.

## 4. Locate Areas Under Human Control

Mark the areas on the map which are settled or controlled by humans. Most humans live near good water sources, along coasts, and in good farmland. *You* may wish to note the details of the system of rulership used by the humans in the whole area.

## 5. Locate Areas Under Nonhuman Control

Then, note areas on the map controlled by other intelligent races—elves, dwarves, halflings, centaurs, orcs, dryads, etc.

Elves prefer wooded places far from men; dwarves and goblins prefer mountains and hills. Halflings live on good farming land or gentle hills if they can. Many monsters choose a "territory" to hunt in and defend, while orcs and similar creatures will raid and move around a great deal. The terrains appropriate for other monsters are noted in the monster descriptions in Chapter 14.

Although nonhuman areas usually have no firm borders, you should note the general areas where demihumans and monsters may be found.

## 6. Describe the Home Town

First, determine how big the characters' home town is:

### Town Sizes

| Type of Community | Population   |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Village           | 50-999       |
| Small Town        | 1,000-4,999  |
| Large Town        | 5,000-14,999 |
| City              | 15,000 +     |

The home town should provide the services most needed by characters, including a place to stay (their family homes, or inns, boarding houses, guild-halls and townhouses), clerical temples, a Thieves' Guild, craft and supply shops—and of course a town guard, to keep an eye on crime.

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_257_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 17: Campaigning

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_257_Picture_2.jpeg)

You should also decide who is running the town. This may be a sheriff appointed by a baron, a town council, a mayor, a powerful merchant prince, a baron, even a high level NPC adventurer. NPC rulers should be at Name level at least, with appropriate bodyguards and magic.

## 7. Fill in Other Details

Finish off the map with a map key, on which you make notes on local NPCs, rumors, and points of interest. This should include some people who hire adventurers (and their reasons), the frequency and scope of local guard patrols, the names of minor town officials and other personalities, and so forth.

## 8. Create Lairs and Encounter Tables

Instead of always using the Wandering Monster tables, you should make up your own encounter tables for wilderness use, based on the creatures you place in the region. Try to be consistent (no giant leeches in desert, no halflings in dense mountains, etc.)

Make notes on a few special monster lairs, but do not place them on the map! Use them when the characters encounter a monster lair, and simply place it where they find it. In a similar manner, draw a few plans for castles, ships, and other things that may be used at a future date.

## Towns and Cities

All characters should start in a home town, from which they may begin their adventures. The home town provides a place where a party can buy equipment, hire men and retainers, sell treasures (and perhaps have magical items identified), and where clerical healing is available for a price or service. Rumors that can lead to adventure can be gathered at inns or taverns. Many of the characters will have grown up in this town and should know many of the NPCs found here.

Most towns should be located very near waterways. Without a good source of water, no town can survive. In some areas, wells may be dug, and a natural spring might have surfaced, attracting early settlers. Streams and other freshwater sources are the most popular to colonists, however, and a fork of a river will probably be the first settled area of any wilderness. The land should be suitable for farming, and most farms will be very near the town.

In "new" towns, most buildings should be made of wood, with stone added to some larger ones. Dirt roads and paths should lead throughout the town, possibly with some few cobblestone main streets if the town is large. Most homes should be in one area, and most businesses in another.

If the town lies near dangerous wilderness, it might have a defensive wall which stands 10'-30' high and with at least two gates. The wall could be a simple log barrier, dirt rampart or could be more elaborate, with walkways and possible siege equipment (catapults, oil cauldrons, etc.) atop it. Each gateway should be enclosed by a tower of some kind, often made of stone. Or it may be circled by a moat with drawbridges.

Each town may have one or more of each of the following types of buildings, areas, and persons (depending on the town's size, location, degree of civilization, government, etc.):

Market Square: Farmers bring their goods into town early each morning, and usually have regular customers in the Market Square section of town. Shortly after dawn, local housewives (and others) come to the Market Square to buy the day's supplies.

Trade Bazaar: The town may have various shops, and possibly a general store, where most items could be purchased. If the town is large or on a trade route, there may be a Trade Bazaar. This is a collection of various merchants and craftsmen, selling their wares from stands or small shops along one or more streets in one part of town. The bazaar can be a noisy, chaotic, colorful place, dangerous to the unwary rich visitor; the thieves are plentiful, both in the crowds and across the counters!

Craft Guilds: The Craft Guilds provide a method of preserving information. Their secrets are carefully guarded, and not for sale. There are Guilds both for crafts (such as rope making) and professions (magic-user, thief, etc.).

A town prosper by trading with other towns. Merchant parties of 1-100 wagons would travel the inhabited areas (rarely risking unexplored wilderness), carrying certain items to places where they may be sold for a profit. Most trade routes quickly become complex businesses with regular schedules.

Town Treasury: Adventurers bring cash into towns, far more than even well-to-do townsfolk would normally have. Any visitor with sacks of gold or gems would be closely watched by thieves and bandits lurking in shadowy alleys. Thus, it is wise for adventurers to visit the town treasury immediately upon arriving, lest their fortunes disappear into the coffers of the Thieves' Guild. The treasury probably taxes all such arrivals, for 10% of the total value. The coins themselves are not simple lumps of metal, but neither are they as finely detailed as our modern coins. Coinsmiths would work for the area's ruler, under heavy guard.

Much more exists within the towns and cities of fantasy worlds than can be placed within these few pages. In addition to those institutions discussed above, there are many more people and businesses essential to life in a medieval settlement:

Alchemist  
Apothecary  
Armorer/Armory  
Astrologer  
Baker/Bakery  
Boat Rental  
Bootmaker  
Brewery  
Dock/Wharf  
Doctor/Dentist  
Foundry  
Fletcher  
Furrier  
Gambler  
Gemcutter  
Govt. Official  
Graveyard  
Guard  
Guild Officer  
Judge

Lawyer  
Leatherworker  
Locksmith  
Monastery  
Moneylender  
Peasant  
Peddler  
Politician  
Public Baths  
Ropemaker  
Sage  
Sailor  
Saloon  
Stables  
Stoneworker  
Tailor  
Warehouses  
Watchman  
Wheelwright  
Jeweler  
Woodcarver

Thus, a medieval fantasy world is no less complex and detailed than our modern world. Each person lives his own life, has hopes and dreams, and does what is necessary to survive. Most people contribute, in one way or another, to the survival of their community. The DM should avoid neglecting the "background" details; although the player characters are the most important to the game, they are actually very small parts of the world in which they live.

## History

You need to come up with at least the basic details of the history of the area: When it was settled, details of wars between rival inhabitants of this area and between this area and other areas, recent history (especially details of the activities of villains, bad rulers, raiders, etc.).

Be sure to work in the characters' details about their families and backgrounds into the local history. If, for instance, a player decided that his character's father was killed by a vampire (to account for the PC's hatred of undead), then you could expand that into the Great Vampire Plague of 15 Years Ago. If the setting has a history, it will seem much more real to the players.

## Languages

You must decide what languages are available in the campaign setting. In most D&D® games, there are 20 or more different languages used by monsters and characters. You may select languages from the List of Common Languages (below), or you may allow the player to choose. Or if you wish, you can add more languages to the list if you think they will be used in your games.

The campaign's Common tongue is going to be the language spoken by the majority of player characters; in a world which (like Earth) has many different human languages, you may have different nations speaking human languages very different from whatever you choose to be the Common tongue.

Note: The speakers of a language never call it the Common tongue; give each unique human language its own name, a name which usually corresponds to the people who speak it. In a campaign set in the Thytian Empire, for instance, the Common tongue would be Thytian.

Remember that the undead do not have languages specific to them; if they are intelligent undead, they speak the languages they spoke when they were alive.

### List of Common Languages

| 1. Other Human  | 11. Halfing       |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Tongues         | 12. Harpy         |
| 2. Bugbear      | 13. Hobgoblin     |
| 3. Doppelganger | 14. Kobold        |
| 4. Dragon       | 15. Lizard Man    |
| 5. Dwarf        | 16. Medusa        |
| 6. Elf          | 17. Minotaur      |
| 7. Gargoyle     | 18. Ogre or Giant |
| 8. Gnoll        | 19. Orc           |
| 9. Gnome        | 20. Pixie         |
| 10. Goblin      |                   |

## Important NPCs

You should work up certain details of NPCs who may prove important to the campaign. You don't necessarily have to work up full-sized character sheets, but you should note the following things:

1. Name
2. Appearance (height, weight, age, gender, clothing, and interesting details)
3. Personality (speech pattern, mannerisms, hobbies, and interests)
4. Occupation and role (what he or she is in the campaign)

NPCs you should work up include local rulers, sages, one or two guardsmen, one or two shop owners, romantic-interest characters, retired adventurers and other sources of information, and people who hate the PCs.

## Government

As mentioned earlier, the standard D&D® game campaign is set in a world resembling 15th-century Europe. This means that the culture is medieval (each area ruled by a petty warlord, who swears allegiance and service to a greater warlord, who in turn swears to protect his subordinate nobles), graduating into Renaissance (an era when the middle class increases in size, wealth, and influence, and when new ground is being broken in the arts, sciences and philosophies).

But you don't have to follow this approach in your own campaign. Other names and forms of government are certainly possible, and even common. The "Known World" setting (described in Appendix 1) includes a group of Jarldoms (ruled by "Jarls"—Earls, who are similar to independent counts), an Emirate (ruled by an Emir, a King of tribes), a Republic, several Freeholds, and others.

The government of your campaign setting, instead of being a feudal system, might be one of the following types:

Confederacy: A united group of independent dominions.

Democracy: A single dominion or confederacy of dominions ruled by the citizens, either directly or through elected rulers.

Dictatorship: Any dominion ruled by one supreme leader (but without nobility or royalty).

Magocracy: Dominion ruled by magic-users.

Militocracy: Government by fighters.

Monarchy (or Autocracy): A dominion ruled by a leader who inherited the title.

Oligarchy: A dominion ruled by two or more rulers equal in power.

Republic: A democracy with elected rulers.

Theocracy: Government by clerics.

## The Immortals

Finally, you can decide on the nature of the campaign's Immortals. You can follow the same procedure shown above for "Important NPCs" to determine what they're like.

For the most part, clerics will be most interested in knowing about the Immortals in the early stages of the campaign; each cleric usually chooses one Immortal to serve throughout his ca-

reer, and each clerical order is usually set up to further the aims of one Immortal.

## Adapting the Game to the Setting

Be aware, too, that you can adapt the game to your setting. *You don't have to use every single detail presented in this book*. If any element is wrong for your campaign setting, you can remove that element.

## Select Character Classes

You might not wish for a specific D&D game character class to be used in your campaign. Perhaps your campaign is to be based on a fantasy novel where there are no dwarves, elves, or halfings—only humans. That's fine! This is your campaign—arrange it any way you want. Simply eliminate the unwanted character classes from your campaign—or alter them to suit yourself (just try to keep them balanced when you do so).

## Select or Modify Spells

Likewise, you might not want every spell in this game to appear in your campaign. Do you think *sleep* is too powerful? Eliminate it, or make it a 2nd- or 3rd level spell in your campaign. Do you want the possibility of character death to be more important in your campaign? Eliminate *raise dead* and similar spells.

You should photocopy a spell book sheet from Appendix 3 and write on it every spell you're modifying or eliminating from the campaign, and keep it handy when you're creating treasure spell-scrolls or NPCs from whom the PCs might learn new spells.

## Select or Modify Monsters

The collection of creatures in Chapter 14 is drawn from many, many different sources: The mythologies of several different cultures and the imaginations of many game-writers have contributed to this enormous list.

Because the list is so varied, you will probably find that not every monster is appropriate for your campaign world. Ruthlessly cast out any monster that is inappropriate to the campaign setting, and introduce new monsters which fit the setting, as you please.

For instance, in a campaign setting which is much like the classical-era real world (ancient Rome, Egypt, Greece, etc.) with magic added, you'd want to keep such monsters as centaurs and sphinxes, mummies and dryads, cockatrice and pegasi, hydras and bronze golems. But other creatures, from the common orc and goblin to the esoteric beholder, detract from the classical feel of the setting; just eliminate them from your campaign (and from your Wandering Monster charts and other encounter charts) to help give the campaign the tone you want.

## Select Optional Rules

Finally, you can go through this book and select any Optional Rules you want to include. Chapters 5 and 19 include many such optional rules, and additional options are scattered

throughout this volume. To decide whether or not you want to use a variant rule, try to calculate what effect the rule will have on your campaign. Weapon mastery, for instance, would force characters to specialize in various weapons, which makes them more powerful with those weapons, and yet makes them more awkward when forced to use weapons outside their specialty. If this is the effect you want, choose the rule. Then, inform your players which optional rules you'll be using.

## Designing Adventures and Dungeons

An adventure is the role-playing equivalent of an action-adventure short story; several adventures leading toward the same goal may seem more like a novel.

### Step by Step

The following steps can be used as a guide in making a good adventure. Read them for ideas, and follow the steps if you wish.

1. Choose a Scenario
2. Decide on a Setting
3. Select Special Monsters
4. Draw the Map
5. Flesh Out the Setting
6. Fill in the Final Details

### 1. Choose a Scenario

A *scenario* is an idea or theme which ties the adventure together. The entire adventure should fit the scenario. A good scenario gives the players a reason for adventuring, and keeps the adventure consistent and logical. The monsters and treasures are placed later, based on the scenario used. In short—the scenario affects *everything* in the adventure.

A scenario can be anything you can imagine! Some examples are given and explained below.

Exploring the Unknown: The party is hired to map unknown territory. The area might once have been familiar but is now overrun or destroyed. A strange tower might mysteriously appear overnight in a familiar area; the local ruler will want it investigated.

Investigating an Enemy Outpost: Enemies (possibly monsters) are invading areas settled by humans. The characters must enter an enemy outpost, find the strengths and plans of the invaders, and destroy them if possible.

Recovering Ruins: The party is scouting an old village before permanent settlers move in. The ruins may have been overrun by a certain type of monster, who must be driven off or slain. The ruins could even be underneath—or part of—a thriving town.

Destroying an Ancient Evil: The so-called "evil" is a monster or NPC, but the exact type is not known to the characters—until they adventure to find out what it is. It may have been deeply buried and reawakened by recent digging, exploring, and so forth.

Visiting a Lost Shrine: To remove a curse or recover a special item, the party must travel to a shrine which has been lost for ages. They have only a rough idea of its location, and may have to

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_259_Picture_0.jpeg)

# Chapter 17: Campaigning

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_259_Picture_2.jpeg)

consult an oracle or seer during the trip.

Fulfilling a Quest: A King (or other powerful NPC) assigns an epic task to a character or party. It may involve the recovery of a valuable or powerful object.

Escaping From Enemies: The characters have been captured! They must escape from their cells deep within a dungeon. (Be sure to make escape, and the recovery of some equipment, possible—though not easy; the PCs should not just be rescued by a powerful NPC.)

Rescuing Prisoners: Valuable or important persons are being held prisoner by an evil group (bandits, orcs, a magic-user with allies). The party may be hired, or may simply be seeking an announced reward. The party may be the guards for a person negotiating the ransom demands.

Using a Magic Portal: A "magic portal" is a device which magically sends creatures from one place to another. It may be a "door" into another dimension or world, and could become the point of an invasion from the far place! It could simply be a way to force the party into a secret part of a dungeon. The party might be on a mission to destroy the portal, or might be hired to reopen or find a closed or lost portal. The portal may be known or secret, and may operate both ways—or one way only!

Finding a Lost Race: The characters find a long-lost race that was once human, but has lived underground so long that many changes have occurred (change of color, animal habits, invavision, etc.).

## 2. Decide on a Setting

Decide where the adventure will take place. You do not yet have to make a full map of the adventure site, but you should decide how the area will look in general. After choosing a general type of area (some examples are given below), make notes on any specific ideas you have for special rooms or areas.

| Abandoned Mine       | Farmlands          |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| Ancient Temple       | Mountains or Hills |
| Castle or Stronghold | Ocean or Sea       |
| Caves or Caverns     | Swamps             |
| Crypt or Tomb        | Town or City       |
| Deep Forest          | Underwater         |
| Desert               | Village            |

## 3. Select Special Monsters

You should select (and *not* roll at random) some special monsters, based on the scenario; these should be the main obstacle in the adventure. You may create new monsters if you choose.

For example, if the scenario is "Recovering Ruins" in a "Ruined Town" setting, the characters might be given the mission to clean the area out of humanoids so that humans can re-occupy the place. You might place a few hobgoblin lairs (15-20 creatures in each), plus their pets and friends, as Special Monsters in this area.

The rest of the ruins can be filled randomly. For example, in a "Recovering Ruins" adventure, other animals could have crept into the ruins, including great cats, wolves or wild dogs, a ghoul preying on the hobgoblins, etc.

## 4. Draw the Map

If the main adventure site is to be outdoors, use hex paper to draw the map (each hex would represent a few dozen or a few hundred yards, depending on the size of the area). With outdoor maps, you'll need to note locations of stands of trees, creeks, buildings, bridges, ravines, cave entrances, hills, natural obstacles, etc.

If the site is underground (such as a dungeon), use graph paper (with each square normally representing a  $10' imes 10'$  area, or any other scale you prefer). With indoor maps, you'll need to note walls, doors, corridors, secret doors, traps, sliding walls, monster lairs, and treasure locations. Some sections of the map may be left blank, to be filled in later.

Remember that this setting can always be used in later adventures; it may, in fact, become a permanent fixture in the campaign.

## 5. Flesh Out the Setting

The process of placing the monsters, traps, and treasures into the adventure site is called "stocking" the site (or stocking the dungeon).

First, place the Special Monsters in their areas, along with their treasures. Then you may either select other creatures or roll for them at random, using either the Wandering Monster Tables or a list of your own.

## 6. Fill in the Final Details

After the rooms have been stocked, you can add details about normal items, sounds, smells, and so forth. Try to add enough detail to make the adventure interesting: They ought to be able to visualize the setting as you describe it, and it should be convincing to them. Don't throw in too much detail! You may find yourself describing a setting until your players grow bored. You will develop a "feel," in time, for the right amount of detail to add.

To finish, you can make a Wandering Monster table suited to the adventure. You'll only need a few monsters—from 4 to 10—and they should be selected to fit the scenario, the setting, and the map. For example, in ruins, the wandering monsters could all be scavenger types (carrion crawler, rats, gelatinous cube), giant beetle, and Special Monsters (1-4 hobgoblin guards, for example).

## Adventure Planning

When you create adventures, try to estimate the difficulty the PCs will face. Encounters which are too easy will bore the players, while those which are too powerful will frustrate them (and kill their characters, incidentally). If you need some help with this, read the "Balancing Encounters" section from Chapter 7.

Don't be tripped up by small details. If you put in a monster which can be harmed by only one sort of attack, you'd better be sure that the PCs have that attack—or can outrun the monster.

Carefully consider alignment and abilities, as well. Lawfuls prefer Chaotic opponents. Two or more Name level clerics can handle many lesser undead. Remember the demi-human abilities (finding secret doors, stone traps, etc.), and add special features for them.

When putting different monsters together in any setting, ask yourself one simple question: What happens when all these creatures are left there for a month? The setting should be "sta-

ble: " the creatures should cooperate or avoid each other for logical reasons. Some adventures may be based on special temporary situations, but this should be the exception, not the general rule.

## Designing Dungeons

A *dungeon* is any indoor place where monsters and treasures may be found. A dungeon is usually a group of rooms, connected by corridors. It could be a castle (new or ruined), some caves, catacombs beneath a city, an actual dungeon once (or currently) used to imprison people, or anything else you can imagine.

Some dungeons are sites which figure prominently in the plot of the current adventure. For example, if a dragon's treasure trove is the goal of the adventure, the dungeon (the series of caves where the dragon, its treasure, and many related monsters live) is tied up with the story. Other dungeons are merely dangerous sites where monsters dwell . . . and where PCs may go to gain experience and treasure by fighting those monsters. Such dungeons are good places to increase a PC's power, but may ultimately be unsatisfactory because they have no relationship to the rest of the campaign world.

The *level of a* dungeon is a number that identifies part of the dungeon, and usually indicates the amount of danger present in that area of the dungeon. Level One, or the "first level," is usually the easiest part of the dungeon—the place where the smallest monsters and treasures can be found. Level Two is more dangerous than Level One, and as the numbers increase, so does the danger. A dungeon may have any number of levels.

### Types of Dungeons

The levels of a dungeon are usually built vertically—one above the other. In most dungeons, the deeper you go, the more dangerous the adventure becomes. The entrance to the dungeon is usually on Level One, and stairs, pits, orchutes (sometimes even elevators) lead to the lower levels.

Some dungeons may be built in the opposite way, with the more difficult levels above the first, rather than below. A tower is one example of this type.

Some dungeons may be built horizontally, with no areas above or below the first. A "lower level" would be a section of the dungeon further from the entrance, but no deeper or higher than the first level. A group of caves is an example of this type.

There may be more than one entrance to a dungeon. All the entrances need not lead to the first level. Some may lead directly to other levels, bypassing the first.

When you design a dungeon, you may use any method you like. It is recommended that you make simple vertical dungeons first, with more dangerous levels below the first level. You may find other types in published modules, and you may construct more elaborate types after some practice.

### Random Stocking

After placing special monsters in a dungeon, you may fill the rest of a dungeon with creatures either at random or by choosing. Many rooms should be left empty. If there are creatures every-

# Chapter 17: Campaigning

where, the dungeon will be too dangerous. Imagine what would happen in the dungeon when the adventurers aren't around. If the monsters would encounter each other often, they should not be enemies; otherwise, the dungeon could be ruined! It would be nearly empty before the adventurers arrive, with all the dungeon treasure in the lair of the last survivors.

To randomly stock a dungeon room, roll 1d6 twice and consult the Room Contents Table. The first roll is to find the contents (monster, trap, special, or empty), and the second roll shows whether treasure is present.

| First Roll  | Second Roll |   |   |   |   |   |
|-------------|-------------|---|---|---|---|---|
|             | 1           | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 1-2 Empty   | T           | — | — | — | — | — |
| 3 Trap      | T           | T | — | — | — | — |
| 4-5 Monster | T           | T | T | — | — | — |
| 6 Special   | —           | — | — | — | — | — |

Use the first roll to find the contents, and then read across to the column under the result of the second roll. If the result is "T," place treasure in the room. Treasure is rarely found with a "Special." In a room with monsters, determine the amount of treasure by the means described in Chapter 16; otherwise, use the Unguarded Treasure Table below.

Silver pieces are always part of randomly placed treasure, and other items might be found. The DM rolls percentage dice, and if the result is equal to or less than the number given, that type of treasure is present. Treasure should rarely be sitting out on the floor. You should decide where the treasure is kept (a locked chest) or hidden (a hollow table leg, etc.).

## Room Contents

The Room Contents Table may call for the placement of a trap or "special." These are explained below.

### Trap

A *trap* is anything that could cause damage, delay or a magical effect to occur. The trap may be found, and possibly removed, by a thief character. Traps may be placed on doors, walls, ceilings, room furnishings (table, chest, etc.) or directly on a treasure. *You* may combine traps, or place several in one area, but try not to make the encounter too dangerous for the characters. Deadly traps are not recommended until the 2nd level of a dungeon (or deeper) is reached. Some typical traps:

Blade: A blade sweeps out, down, or up, hitting someone (possibly allowing a saving throw) for damage.

Creature: A monster (snake, beetle, spider, etc.) jumps up and gets one free attack by surprise.

Darts: Some tiny darts, shot by a spring mechanism, shoot out and hit someone (either automatic hits or by making attack rolls), for damage or some other effect (paralysis, poison, etc.).

Explosion: Something blows up, causing damage to everyone in the area—any set amount or dice range, but a saving throw vs. spells should allow damage to be reduced to half.

Falling Items: A block (or rubble) falls when something is touched (or at random), striking someone and allowing a saving throw vs. wands for trying to jump out of the way) for damage (either a given number or a dice range).

Fog: Looks like poison gas, but a failed saving throw results in (pick one): nothing, giggles, fear, a terrible smell for 1d6 turns (which may attract monsters or increase wandering monster chances), anger (victims attack each other for 1d4 rounds; a saving throw may be applied), or paralysis.

Illusion: Something strange happens (but not really; see *phantasmal force*, a magic-user's spell), and the characters may be scared away (or the illusion may have some other effect, such as giving a false clue, luring characters toward another trap, etc.).

Light: A bright light flashes, and all seeing it are blinded for a time (a saving throw vs. spells should apply, possibly with a bonus or penalty to the roll).

Pit: A section of floor gives way, and (one, some, or all) characters fall in, taking 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 2d6, or more points of damage. The pit may have something at the bottom (spikes for more damage, deep water, or a monster). It may instead be a chute, leading down (a one-way ride) to the next dungeon level.

Poison Gas: Victims make saving throws vs. poison or take damage (1d4 points, 1d6 points, or whatever is dangerous but not deadly to most characters). Optionally, a saving throw vs. poison with bonuses (+1, +2, +4) to the roll may be made, with failure meaning death. Gas is usually in a container, released when opened.

Poison Needle: This is a small needle, hidden somewhere and nearly undetectable until accidentally touched, when it will spring out and poke a character who tries to open something.

### Special

A "special" is anything you place which is not normal, but is not a trap, monster, or treasure. Some typical "specials" are:

Alarm: The noise summons a special monster, opens dungeon doors, or has no effect at all.

Illusion: A dungeon feature (stairs, room, door, monster, treasure, etc.) is not really there, but is merely a phantasm.

Map Change: A shifting wall moves after the party passes, cutting off their exit. They must find another way out of the dungeon. The wall shifts back after a time (1 turn, 1 hour, 1 day).

Movement: The room (or stairs, or door, or item) moves (turns, drops, closes, rises, etc.) unexpectedly. It might be stopped if a roll for surprise (often with -1, -2, or ~3 penalty) shows that the party reacts quickly enough to prevent it.

Pool: Magical water has a strange effect if touched (or drunk, or sprinkled on someone or something), such as healing, inflicting damage, changing an ability score, making something magical for a time, invisible for a time, etc.

Sounds: The room (or item) makes strange noises—moaning, screaming, talking, etc.

Statue: A large statue of a person, monster, or gadget (nearly anything you can imagine) is found. It may be valuable, magical, too heavy to move, alive, lonesome and willing to talk (maybe a liar), covering a trap door down, a treasure, etc.

Transportation: This could be a trap door leading up or down, secret stairs, elevator, magical portal to elsewhere (another room, another level, another dungeon), etc.

Trick Monster: This applies to any variation of a listed monster, such as: a two-headed giant ogre, a carrion crawler that walks upright and has paralyzing tentacles for arms, a wild bore (a shaggy man who tells long, dreary stories), a quartering (half-sized halfling), a Mouth Harpy (who can't sing but plays the harmonica), an Ogre Jelly (looks like an ogre, but . . .), and so forth.

Weird Things: You may let your imagination run, placing such things as: weapons which fly (attacking by themselves), talking skulls, a magical item or treasure firmly stuck to the floor (or wall, or ceiling), a magical area (zero gravity, reversed gravity, growth to double size, shrink to 1" tall; effect lasts until the characters leave the area), a huge creature recently slain (too big to fit through the corridors—"But how did it get here?"), and so forth.

## Wandering Monsters

In a dungeon, monsters are often encountered in rooms. The rooms may be their lairs, or the creatures may simply be "passing through," having lairs elsewhere.

These encounters are with "Placed" monsters—creatures mentioned, in the dungeon description, as being in one specific place. However, monsters may also wander around, and be encountered during their travels. The DM does not place these creatures in any one spot. Instead, they are listed in a special wandering monster table, included with the dungeon description. This chart, designed by the DM, is part of the design of most dungeons.

One wandering monster table may be used for an entire dungeon, or separate lists may be made for each level of the dungeon. A typical such table is the Wilderness Encounters Table on page 95, which is further divided into subtables.

# Running Adventures

## The Campaign Group

Normally, when a group gets together to play the game, one player acts as the Dungeon Master, who takes on the tasks of creating the world and running adventures; the other members of the group are the players. Part of what we'll be talking about involves ways for the DM and players to get along and cooperate while playing the

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_261_Picture_2.jpeg)

game; some of what we'll talk about involves ways for the players to work with one another.

D&D® games usually work best with small groups—one DM and four to six players. Experienced DMs may choose to take larger groups... but the larger a group is, the less individual attention each character will get. (In a story with a really large cast of characters, such as a disaster movie, each individual character gets less air time than a story with a smaller cast.)

## Dungeon Master Setup

### Levels of Play

A carefully designed campaign can handle characters of all levels. If your experienced players have characters of various levels, be sure to have play sessions for the different levels of the characters. Characters should normally adventure with other characters of similar level.

*Mixing Levels of Characters:* During a campaign, new characters often enter the game, either replacing lost ones or brought by new players. But at the same time, more successful characters will continue to advance in experience. This creates a large difference between the levels of the different characters.

This difference can cause great problems. As a guideline, if the difference in levels is five or more, the characters should adventure separately. This guideline will not apply at all times, and should not be applied to games using retainers.

The Pre-Game Checklist lists some things the DM should find out before starting play for the first time.

### Pre-Game Checklist

1. Do all the players know how to play?
2. Have you read this book all the way to the end? Are there any rules you're not familiar with?
3. Do you and all the players know why the characters are embarking on this new adventure?
4. Are all the characters ready to go and equipped for the adventure?
5. Have the players chosen a caller and a mapper? Do they have a piece of graph paper and a pencil, to map with?

If any answer is "No," stop to fix the problem.

### The Most Important Rule

There is one rule which applies to everything you will do as a Dungeon Master. It is the most important of all the rules! This is it: Be Fair.

A Dungeon Master must not take sides. A DM who likes his monsters and NPCs better than he likes the PCs, and maliciously sets out to abuse the PCs at every opportunity, is *not* a good DM.

As DM, you will play the roles of the creatures encountered, but should do so fairly, without favoring the monsters or the characters. Play the monsters as they would actually behave, at least as you imagine them.

The players are *not* fighting or competing with the DM! The characters may be fighting monsters, but everyone is playing the game to have fun. The players have fun exploring and earning more powerful characters, and the DM has fun playing the monsters and entertaining players.

For example, it's not fair to change the rules unless everyone knows about the change. When you add optional rules, apply them evenly to everyone, players and monsters. Do not make exceptions; stick to the rules, and be fair.

## The Dungeon Master's Job

A D&D game is basically a series of encounters, with other actions (such as movement and problem solving) between them. The dice are often used to find results when choices must be made. All the dice rolls are called "game mechanics." The game consists mostly of role playing, game mechanics, and strategy.

During an encounter, the players make the attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for their characters. You, the Dungeon Master, make similar rolls for the monsters, plus other rolls to find the monsters' actions (such as reactions and morale).

### The DM's Roles

You will play the roles of all the monsters, townspeople, and other creatures encountered. The best Dungeon Masters are able to play several roles at once—such as when the characters meet another party of adventurers, all played by the DM!

However, your creatures are not as detailed as the PCs, and are easier to play. Their actions are often determined by dice rolls. One rule applies to all the creatures, even though there are many different types: Imagine how the creature feels.

The actions of a creature are often determined by its alignment or Intelligence. For example, an animal is not very smart, and will act very simply—hungry and hostile, neutral and unconcerned, or friendly. More intelligent creatures may be thinking of many different things; food, treasure, home and friends, and so forth.

When an encounter seems likely, think about how the creatures feel, and how they might act. When the encounter begins, you will often roll dice to find the actual reactions of the creatures. The results should be adjusted for the creatures' intelligence, habits, and other details.

Imagine how your creatures will react to these dangerous, greedy characters stomping around the caves! The monsters will try to survive and be happy in their own ways, and will often fight to defend their homes and treasures.

*But remember*—although the monsters may be fighting the characters, *you* are not fighting the players. If you try to entertain them, they will entertain you. Play the roles of the monsters, but forget them when they are slain. Their only purpose, in the long run, is to provide entertainment.

### Reactions

When an encounter begins, you may find the actions of monsters by making Reaction rolls (see "Reactions" in Chapter 7). The results are a guide to playing the monsters' response to the arrival of the characters.

An encountered creature might attack automatically. Other monsters, however, do *not* always attack, so be sure to read the monster descriptions carefully.

Many creatures can be friendly or unfriendly, depending on the situation. Their reactions can sometimes be determined by the actions of the

characters. If a fighter has a sword out and charges at a goblin, the goblin is not going to think the fighter is friendly! The goblin might attack and might run away, but probably won't try to talk.

More often, however, the characters will wait and "see what the monsters do" before they start anything. Likewise, most monsters will usually wait to see how the characters act! When this type of encounter begins, you should make a reaction roll for the monsters, using 2d6. Up to three reaction rolls may be needed to finish the encounter.

Likewise, when you feel that you know a monster's or NPC's personality, you can dispense with reaction rolls altogether for that encounter, playing the monster/NPC as you imagine he would act and react.

Whenever the characters attack the monsters, stop rolling for reactions. The monsters will fight to defend themselves, and might run away.

### Running the Game

During most of a D&D game, the Dungeon Master leaves the decisions to the players. The DM presents the setting—describing what the characters see, offering choices of actions, and so forth. But the course of the game is determined by the actions of the party, as decided by all the players. The DM can almost relax and enjoy the characters' progress as they explore, make maps, solve puzzles, and so forth.

The DM usually deals with the characters as a group, rather than the individuals. However, when an encounter begins, a change occurs. The DM takes a more active role, becoming more aware of the actions of each character. The players have a more limited choice of actions as they confront a monster or NPC. The DM plays the roles of each of the creatures encountered, and decides their actions while considering those of the characters. Game time passes in "slow motion," as the DM carefully considers the round-by-round action (10 seconds at a time) and announces the results.

### Ending an Adventure

Before any game begins, the DM and players should set a time for the game to end—and stick to it. An adventure might end before that time (if the characters become severely wounded, use up all their spells, are fully loaded with treasure, etc.). They might "go home, rest a day or two, and return" if time permits further adventuring.

At the end of an adventure, you announce the total treasure found (and kept) by the party, so the players can divide it. While the players are dividing treasure, you may spend the time calculating the experience points earned during the adventure.

*You* should have records of all the creatures defeated by the party on an Adventure Record Sheet (page 298). If not, take a few minutes to remember the creatures encountered.

# Chapter 18: The Planes of Existence

The world in which the characters live is only one of many worlds in their infinite universe; the possibilities for "normal" adventure are limitless. But the D&D® game involves other places and things not found in the "normal" world; the three-dimensional universe is only a small part of reality! There are many other places waiting to be found. The most common beyond the Prime Plane (the "normal" universe) are the other planes of existence.

Think of the entire normal universe as only one page in a large book. Two pages next to each other are touching, but are separate and entirely different. Moving across one page doesn't take you to the next one; you must go in a different direction altogether. In a similar manner, many planes exist, and characters need magic to travel from one plane to another. The whole network of planes: Prime, Ethereal, inner, Astral, and outer, is called the *multiverse*.

## Arrangement of the Planes

Most of a campaign takes place in a fantasy world similar to our own medieval times. That planet, and the whole of that universe, is called the *Prime Plane*.

One other plane touches the Prime Plane, the *Ethereal Plane*, also called "the Ether." Travel to or through it requires magic. The "distance" to it cannot be measured in feet or miles; it is a magical distance, in a magical direction.

A *potion* or *armor of ethereality* allows the user to enter, travel in, and leave the Ethereal Plane. Many strange monsters wander through the Ether, including banshees and poltergeists.

The four elemental planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water are "near" the Prime Plane (as magical distances are measured), but do not touch it like the Ether does. To reach an elemental plane, a hole must be opened in the Prime Plane, and a tube must be created through the Ether, leading to the elemental plane. The hole is called a *vortex*, and the tube is called a *wormhole*.

Vortexes and wormholes can be created by *gate* spells, and can be made permanent with *wishes*. Several permanent wormholes connect the elemental planes with the Prime Plane, and elemental material is constantly flowing between the planes. This movement creates wind, ocean currents, volcanos, and occasional earthquakes.

Experienced travelers of the planes from the Prime Plane refer to the Prime Plane, Ethereal Plane, and elemental planes as the *inner planes*, for there are many other planes of existence. The inner planes are surrounded by the Astral Plane, which can be reached from the Elemental or Ethereal Planes. Think of the inner planes as a group of islands in a vast ocean; this ocean is the Astral Plane. It is similar to the Ether, but much larger. Across the "Astral Ocean" are the *outer planes*, the homes of the Immortals and other strange creatures.

## Interplanar Adventures Visualizing

When you describe a dungeon room or corridor to the players, they can usually imagine what it looks like. The characters' surroundings are always

made of normal matter. Air exists, and can be breathed. Gravity exists, providing directions of "up" and "down." These things rarely change, and the players can accurately "visualize" where their characters are, what they are doing, and what their surroundings are like. The hardest part of adventuring in other planes is visualizing what they are like.

An adventure in a wormhole is much like a dungeon adventure, merely vertical instead of horizontal. Air exists, and the flow through the wormhole provides a gravity of sorts. Thus, the DM and players can gradually become used to elemental adventures by exploring the wormholes, not visiting the other planes until ready for them.

### Time

Time passes on the Ethereal Plane and elemental planes just as it does on the Prime Plane. If adventurers explore wormholes and other nearby planes for a week, then a week will have passed on the Prime Plane when they return. However, time may pass at different rates—slower, faster, or not at all!—on more distant planes.

### Gravity

The pull created by very large masses exists normally on the elemental planes, but is somewhat different on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures in the Ether are not affected by gravity, but can sense the pull of gravity on the nearby Prime Plane.

### Vortexes and Wormholes

A *vortex* is an invisible hole in a plane, with elemental matter either whirling into or erupting out of it. A current of elemental matter flows in one direction, to or from the elemental plane.

If seen by a *detect invisible* spell or similar magic, it appears as a shimmering colored circle from the front or back—but cannot be seen at all from the side; it has no thickness. On the Prime Plane, the color of the vortex matches the plane to which it leads—blue for Air, brown for Earth, red for Fire, and green for Water. Other colors match other more distant planes. On other planes, a vortex leading to the Prime Plane is a multi-colored swirl of the four elemental colors. A vortex may appear to float in the air or lie on a surface. A natural elemental vortex is always located in the element corresponding to its destination (whirlpool, volcano), but a created vortex (by a *gate* spell) may appear anywhere.

A *wormhole* is a connecting passage between planes. It is simply a round tube with wrinkled sides, appearing very similar to a dungeon corridor but without any corners. However, a wormhole seems to be a vertical passage, rather than horizontal, because of the current through it. Traveling in the wormhole with the current is easier than traveling against it.

A wormhole is never straight, bending and winding along its entire length, thus its name. Many of the things inside a wormhole are made of elemental material (matching the plane to which it leads), but other elements and creatures are often present. Wormholes cannot be seen from the Prime Plane, and only the outside can be seen from the Ether. The outer surface looks like a

wrinkled, lumpy gray tube; it is sticky. The surface is actually made of *ectoplasm* (solid ether), compressed by the magic needed to create the wormhole. Wormholes vary in size, from a thick string size to a pillar or slightly curved wall.

Each wormhole is usually 10 miles long or more. The network of permanent wormholes between the Prime Plane and elemental planes looks similar to the roots of a plant; each small wormhole joins a larger one, until all the smaller wormholes connect to one huge wormhole connected to the elemental plane itself.

Creatures and things in a wormhole are magically changed into the "proper" element when they reach the elemental plane, unless protected by powerful magic.

## The Ethereal Plane

A character's first experience with another plane will probably be a short trip into the Ethereal Plane. *Ether*, the material of the Ethereal Plane, appears to be a gray fog in its normal form. If compressed (either by a creature or by magic), it is a sticky gray solid.

Any ethereal creature can sense the direction of gravity on the Prime Plane, but is not affected by it. Thus, while ethereal, a character knows the direction of "down," but cannot fall.

### Vision

When on the Ethereal Plane, vision is normal, with the same range as in a dark underground corridor. Except for creatures, everything is the same color (gray fog) and temperature (about 50° Fahrenheit, or 10° Celsius), so infrared is nearly useless. All light sources function normally (a torch or lantern shining light to 30° range, magical light to greater ranges, etc.), but they only light the Ether, not reaching into wormholes or into the Prime Plane.

An ethereal traveler cannot see into the Prime Plane unless he uses a *detect invisible* spell (or similar magical effect). However, the gray fog of the Ether may be dense or thin, varying by what is nearby on the Prime Plane. Nearby water appears as dark ether, and rock, earth and wood as even thicker ether. Dense rock and heavy metals (lead, gold, etc.), appear as solid ether (*ectoplasm*). Fire on the nearby Prime Plane appears as bright Ether. By noting these changes of density (which affect ethereal movement), a traveler can tell what the conditions are nearby on the Prime Plane, or can at least make a good guess.

### Breathing

Characters can breathe normally in the Ethereal Plane; the Ether itself is a magical, though sterile, air which can support life.

### Movement

Characters cannot walk on the Ethereal Plane. Without magical movement capability, a visitor to the Ether cannot travel. A *fly* spell allows normal movement (120' round); a *poison* or *armor of ethereality* gives the same rate of travel as a *fly* spell would in the Prime Plane. Thus, a traveler moves through the Ether according to the conditions on the nearby Prime Plane, as shown in the Movement in the Ethereal Plane Table.

## Movement in the Ethereal Plane Table

| Type of Material | Effect on Movement Rate |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Vacuum           | Double normal           |
| Air              | Normal                  |
| Fire or Water    | 3/4 normal              |
| Soil, Wood       | 1/2 normal              |
| Rock             | 1/4 normal              |
| Metal            | Reduced to 0'           |
| Lead             | Reduced to 0'           |

## Elemental Planes

Use the following general guidelines to create adventures on and involving the elemental planes. The Components of the Elemental Planes Table can give you some ideas.

Each elemental plane is a universe much like the Prime Plane, but all the material is a single element. The elemental matter collects in clumps (planets, moons, etc.); it can exist in solid, liquid, or gaseous form.

For instance, in the elemental plane of Water, the atmosphere is an unbreathably thick fog, the seas are made of water, and all land, solid objects, and even solid creatures are made of ice—ice which may be so hard and imperishable that it resembles crystal and does not melt in warm temperatures.

The strange creatures of the elemental planes are mixtures of solid and liquid material, held together by a life force of thought and energy (much like creatures on the Prime Plane).

When a planet exists on an elemental plane in roughly the same "position" as a planet on the Prime Plane, natural vortexes and wormholes appear, connecting the planets on each plane. Thus, for the "normal" D&D world, there are four other planets in similar positions, one on each of the elemental planes. Other planets in the Prime universe might not have corresponding elemental planets; another world might thus be missing one or more elements.

Moons, comets, and other large moving bodies on the Prime Plane rarely have any elemental connections. They are sometimes created by temporary wormholes, which break when the corresponding body on the elemental plane moves out of position. In a similar manner, a vortex may suddenly appear on a moving body, as a corresponding moon "nears it" on the elemental plane. For example, an ocean could suddenly appear on a moon near the characters' world!

Some creatures of the elemental planes are described in Chapter 14. You may construct whole civilizations, as interesting and complex as those on the characters' world, with that information. Adventuring can proceed much as it always has, but with entirely new settings, encounters, and even new treasures.

## Movement

Characters can move across the elemental planes just as they do on the Prime Plane. On "land" (i.e., the solid elemental surfaces), they can walk. They can use *fly* spells or devices (or flying mounts) to move through the air. Spells such as *teleport* work normally.

## Breathing

The atmospheres of all the elemental planes except Air are *hazardous* to player characters. For example, the atmosphere of the plane of Water is gaseous water (this would have to be superheated on the Prime Plane to exist in this state, but on the elemental plane can exist at ordinary temperatures); only a water-breathing character can breathe it. The atmosphere of the plane of Earth is gaseous earth matter; that of Fire is a volume of none-too-cool flame. Even the plane of Air has areas filled with poisonous or corrosive gas. To survive on the elemental planes, the characters will have to employ magic—spells, magical items, or both.

\* Or a *poison offire resistance*

**Note:** A *force field spell* (M8) will provide protection on any plane, but is immobile.

## Effects on Magic

These notes apply only to the inner planes. The Astral Plane and outer planes cause other changes in magical effects, because of their differing natural laws.

In the D&D game, magic on the Prime Plane is a highly developed art. However, magic as the

characters know it was created in a unique setting—the Prime Plane, a perfectly balanced mixture of all four elements. This situation is not found in any other plane of the multiverse!

Some magical effects are not based on elements at all, but on energy. Examples include *detect spells*, *cures*, *light* and *darkness*, and *lightning bolts*. These effects will function "normally" (as they do on the Prime Plane) when used on any inner plane.

Other effects are partially or wholly based on matter, affecting it in various ways. These effects may be negated, partially changed, or completely different, as described in "Spells" below.

Beings of different elements affect each other in logical ways. The basic principles used are *dominance* and *opposition*. If one element has dominance over another, it has power over that element. If two elements are in opposition, they are enemies, but affect each other normally. The principles of dominance and opposition are easily summarized:

Air has dominance over Water.

Water has dominance over Fire.

Fire has dominance over Earth.

Earth has dominance over Air.

Air and Fire are in opposition.

Earth and Water are in opposition.

![Diagram illustrating the Elemental Planes and their relationships. A circular diagram shows the four elemental planes (Air, Earth, Water, Fire) arranged around a central point. Arrows indicate the flow of power between them. The relationships are: Air dominates Water, Water dominates Earth, Earth dominates Fire, and Fire dominates Air. The diagram is labeled 'DOMINANCE — OPPOSITION'.]()![](_page_263_Picture_34.jpeg)

In combat between elemental beings, dominance and opposition have the following effects:

Dominance results in double damage; the victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to take normal damage.

When one creature has dominance over another, it is less affected by the other's normal attacks. Only minimum damage is inflicted against the dominant creature. If a water elemental's damage is normally 3d8 points, the water elemental's damage against an air elemental would be only 3 points per successful hit. The victim of dominance tends to fear the other; if a reaction roll indicates hostility, "flee" should replace "attack."

Opposition results in hostility; a penalty applies to all reaction rolls. The penalty is —8 if the creatures are totally opposed (element vs. element and good vs. evil), or —4 otherwise.

When two creatures are in opposition, no change in damage occurs; only reactions are affected. The creatures' reactions to others are not

## Components of the Elemental Planes Table

| Type of Component | Elemental Plane of: |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Air               | Earth               |
| Atmosphere        | Dust or Soil        |
| Liquids           | Mud, Oil or Water   |
| Invisible         | Lava                |
| Airy Liquid       | Earth or Stone      |
| Solids            | Solid Clouds        |

affected; the penalty applies only to reactions to the creature of opposing element.

**Example:** A party is attacked by a fire elemental, so their magic-user casts a *conjure water elemental* spell. Each blow from the resulting water elemental inflicts double damage upon the fire elemental, but it may make a saving throw (per blow) to take normal damage.

**Example:** A djinni (good) meets an *effreeti* (evil); each has a -8 penalty to all reaction rolls. A kryst meets an undine (both good); a -4 penalty applies to all their reaction rolls.

#### Notes on Spells

The spells learned on the Prime Plane usually function normally in the Ether and on the elemental planes unless affected by dominance or opposition (see above). Most spells can easily be translated by replacing the terms "stone" with "solid element," "water" with "liquid element," and "flesh" with "solid/liquid element."

Spell-using creatures native to other planes know "local" versions of many spells. These spells include the clerical *barrier*, *create water*, and *resist fire* spells, and the magic-user *charm person*, *cloudkill*, *fireball*, *delayed blast fireball*, *ice storm/wall*, *lower water*, *magic missile*, *massmorph*, *move earth*, *pass-wall*, *statue*, *water breathing* and *web* spells, and all *wall* spells.

A visitor from the Prime Plane could learn the "local" version of these spells, if taught by a friendly resident. However, local elemental versions of spells will work *only* on the same plane; a *flesh to ice* learned on the plane of Water would have no effect if cast on any other plane, including the plane of Fire (despite dominance).

#### Spells with Limited Effects

Druid spells are useless on any plane but the Prime Plane; they are based entirely on knowledge of Nature as it exists on the Prime Plane.

A cleric's *create normal animals* has no effect on an elemental plane unless the local versions of animals are well-known. A cleric's *aerial servant* spell has no effect on the plane of Air, but functions normally elsewhere; the same applies to the *invisible stalker* magic-user spell. *Weather control* has no effect on any plane but the Prime Plane. Prime Plane insect-based spells will not work on any other plane.

#### Special Spell Notes

**Conjure Elemental:** When a magic-user casts this spell on the Prime Plane, the magic opens a vortex on both planes (both the elemental plane and the Prime Plane) and creates a tiny *wormhole* connecting them. The wormhole is very small—less than an inch across—and it pulls a life force from the elemental plane through the vortex. The life force appears on the Prime Plane near the spellcaster, and forms a body from material nearby.

To form a body, the elemental life force can only use material it is familiar with; a water elemental must have water, an earth elemental must have earth, and so forth. When the magic ends, the creature's life force goes back to its plane through the wormhole, and the wormhole and both vortexes disappear.

When seen from an elemental plane, the elemental affected by the spell simply disappears. The material of its body suddenly dissipates and

drifts, with no life force left to hold it together. When the life force returns, it immediately forms a new body, and resumes its "normal" life.

**Disintegrate:** This spell works normally except against an *elemental* on its home plane. It causes an elemental to split into many creatures of 1 Hit Die each; the number of creatures is equal to the Hit Dice of the elemental affected. Each new elemental has only 1d4 hit points.

**Stone to Flesh:** This spell affects solid matter and often material over which the caster has control, and turns it into living matter. Each elemental plane has a similar version. Each elemental version changes a solid element over which the caster has dominance into a living elemental form. For example, the local version on the plane of Water is *ice to water* and *fire to water*. The reverse of the spell has similar local effects, but changes an elemental creature into non-living solid form. For example, on the plane of Water, the reversed spell is *flesh to ice*.

### The Astral Plane

Much like the Prime Plane, the Astral Plane contains vast reaches of nearly empty space. Planets, stars, and other typical huge objects can be found here. Entire outer planes found "in" the Astral Plane are bubble-like; completely isolated and surrounded by the Astral.

In the Astral Plane, all things appear to be outlined in a sparkling, shimmering substance. Mortals perceive themselves as flat, two-dimensional beings, while Immortals will be seen as solid three-dimensional beings. Huge objects that are normally three-dimensional appear to be two-dimensional. Most outer planes and Immortal constructs will appear three-dimensional.

### The Astral Boundary

The Astral Plane can be reached from the elemental planes by using a magical *gate*, or from the Ethereal Plane at the Astral boundary. From the Ethereal Plane, the boundary appears as a distant shimmering light that becomes brighter as it is approached. The boundary can be crossed magically in either direction (using *plane travel*, etc.), but no permanent crossing exists or can be made. From the Astral Plane, the Ethereal boundary appears as an unmistakable dull gray. Magical sight can penetrate the boundary in both directions.

### Movement

Normal movement when on the Astral Plane (such as walking) is only possible when a surface is present. The usual means of travel is by flight. Gravity is present only when a solid is nearby, and has only minor effects (similar to Ether-Prime gravity effects).

Magical travel loses one dimension of capacity. *Teleport* allows three-dimensional flight, as the *fly spell* (dimension *door* allows flight at half speed). A *fly spell* allows *levitation*. A *levitation spell* is useless.

There are no *signposts* to inner or outer planes, so it is very easy for the inexperienced to get lost; a *wish* or magical navigation aid might be critically important if adventuring here.

### Effects on Magic

The magical strength of any item in the Astral Plane is reduced by one; a *sword* +4 becomes a *sword* +3 in all respects while there. An item of +1 enchantment becomes nonmagical on this plane.

Three-dimensional magic of mortals becomes two-dimensional, parallel with the caster. Thus a *fireball* would create a disc-like explosion that might not harm someone standing very close to the center. The caster can learn to rotate the two-dimensional effect after 3 to 6 castings, so as to be able to cause the explosion to occur in a non-parallel direction. In any event, area effect spells will cause no damage if a saving throw is made.

Magic of Immortal origin remains fully three-dimensional. On the Astral Plane, all mortals suffer a -5 saving throw penalty against magical effects of Immortal origin.

### The Outer Planes

It would be impossible to describe all the different types of outer planes which can exist in a campaign. There are planes where dragons come from, planes where the Immortals live, planes where many undead spirits collect, and an infinity of other planes besides.

Each of these planes can have its own laws which modify the effects of magic spells; each can have its own inhabitants and monsters. The DM decides which new magical laws and which new monsters appear in each outer plane.

To get to one of the outer planes, a character must know something about the plane; he cannot simply infer that it exists. Then, he must use a *gate* or a *wish* to create a vortex or wormhole leading there. Nothing can make this access permanent; the end that the PCs enter disappears one turn after it is created, and the end through which the PCs emerge disappears one turn after the first creature emerges from it.

You can decide which outer planes to use in your campaign according to your campaign needs, particularly when the characters reach high experience levels. If you want your characters to be heavily involved with the Immortals, you can arrange for a set of adventures to take place in an Immortal's plane, for example. Create and use each plane as you need it, and you will not waste any effort by creating vast numbers of outer planes your characters may never visit.

### Beyond the Multiverse

Unsuspected by all but the most powerful magic-users (M26+), beyond the multiverse are alternative realities, called "dimensions." It is guessed that other dimensions coexist in the same space as the multiverse, yet cannot be detected by mortal perceptions. Even Immortals, with their heightened perceptions, may have limited powers in alternative dimensions. One such dimension is the *Nightmare Dimension*, which is inhabited by creatures that haunt the dreams of mortal and Immortal alike.

Past all planes and dimensions lies a mysterious barrier, called the *Dimensional Vortex*, home to horrific monsters called "vortex creatures." Here, even the Immortals fear to tread.

# Chapter 19: Variant Rules

![](_page_265_Picture_1.jpeg)

This is a chapter of optional rules—rules you can introduce into your campaign if you wish. These rules also serve as useful examples for ways you, the DM, can modify the game to suit yourself. Instead of using the options in this chapter, you can introduce your own unique modifications.

## Ability Scores and Saving Throws

In the standard rules, the only ability score that can affect a saving throw is Wisdom (affects saving throws vs. spells). The DM does, however, have the option to apply ability score bonuses and penalties to other saving throws:

*Strength*: Modifies saving throws vs. paralysis and turn to stone.

*Intelligence\**: Modifies saving throws vs. mind attacks (charm, confusion, control, fear, feeblemind, sleep, etc.).

*Wisdom\**: Modifies saving throws vs. spells.  
*Dexterity*: Modifies saving throws vs. wands and dragon breath.

*Constitution*: Modifies saving throws vs. poison (but not vs. death ray).

*Charisma*: No bonus to saving throws.

\* Combined modifier cannot exceed + / — 3.

## Death in the Campaign

If you want your campaign to behave more like the fantasy stories you read or see in the movies, you might get rid of spells and magical items that bring people back to life. This includes spells such as *raise dead*, *raise dead fully*, *reincarnation*, and *clone*.

This makes the campaign a lot more dangerous. When a character is dead, he's dead. The player characters will be a bit choosier about the fights they pick, and will run away from fights more often. High level characters will be rarer, as bad luck and player lapses will take a higher toll.

This option gives character death more impact. It should be a sad and momentous event when a character dies—not just a delay in the proceedings. At best, it sharpens the players' perceptions of how mortal their characters are. At worst, it leads to general player dissatisfaction. It is not recommended unless the players are mature enough to handle losing a favorite character.

## Keeping Characters Alive

If you decide to get rid of the resurrection spells, you can also adopt another rule to make it a little harder for characters to die.

For instance, when a character is reduced to 0 hit points or below in combat (or from death spells), he's not yet dead. He's unconscious and mortally wounded; if left untended, he will die.

He must make a saving throw vs. death ray every turn. He makes the first roll on the round he drops to 0 hit point; he makes another every round he takes additional damage, and every 10 minutes (one turn) in addition. If he ever fails a roll, he's dead.

If he keeps making his rolls until reached by a healing cleric, someone with the Healing general skill, or someone with a healing potion to get to

## Dwarf

**Attack Probability:** The dwarf following these rules no longer uses Attack Rank values to determine how well he hits. Instead, he rolls on the Attack Rolls Chart just like a fighter of identical level.

**Hit Points:** Above 9th level, the dwarf following these rules gets only 2, not 3, hit points per level. As usual, Constitution adjustments do not apply.

**Saving Throws:** The dwarfs saving throws do not improve beyond the saving throws shown for the dwarf class in Chapter 2.

## Elf

**Attack Probability:** The elf following these rules no longer uses Attack Rank values to determine how well he hits. Instead, he rolls on the Attack Rolls Chart just like a cleric of identical level.

him, he can be saved. If the healers can heal him up to 1 hit point or more, or the Healing skill roll is made at a penalty of -5 (regardless of whether it heals him up to positive hit point or not), then the character is alive. He's critically wounded—but he'll survive.

## Demihuman and Mystic Experience Levels

Demihumans and mystics are currently limited as to how high they can rise in experience levels. This is because they start off with many more abilities than normal human characters; it's a rule that keeps them in balance.

However, in your own campaign, you might prefer to allow these classes to rise to 36th level, just like the normal human classes. Using this rule will require you to re-evaluate your campaign balance. If you want to do this, here are some guidelines.

Spells: An elf following these rules uses the same Spells/Level chart as the Magic-User class.

Hit Points: Above 9th level, the elf gets 1 hit point per level, and Constitution adjustments do not count.

Saving Throws: The elf's saving throws do not improve beyond the saving throws shown for the elf class in Chapter 2.

## Halfling

Attack Probability: The halfling following these rules no longer uses Attack Rank values to determine how well he hits. Instead, he rolls on the Attack Rolls Chart just like a cleric of identical level.

Wilderness Abilities: The halfling's wilderness abilities to hide himself do not improve with experience.

Hit Points: At 9th level, the halfling gets one more 1d6 roll for hit points, his last. Above 9th level, the halfling following gets 1 hit point per level, and Constitution adjustments do not count.

Saving Throws: The halfling's saving throws do not improve beyond the saving throws shown for the halfling class in Chapter 2.

## Mystic

Attack Probability: The mystic following these rules he rolls on the Attack Rolls Chart just like a fighter of identical level.

Hit Points: As before, above 9th level, the mystic receives 2 hit points per level, and Constitu-

tution adjustments no longer count.

Special Abilities That Do Not Improve: Above 16th level, the mystic's armor class, movement rate, number of attacks, and hand-to-hand damage *no longer improve*. He does not gain any new special abilities; his hand-to-hand equivalency to magical weapons does not exceed +5.

Special Abilities That Do Improve: The mystic will still continue to improve as a fighter and adventurer. His experience level will continue to improve and dictate how well he hits; his saving throws will continue to improve; he will continue to gain hit points; his thiefabilities and his Acrobatics skill (which is partially dictated by his experience level) will continue to improve; and (if you're using those rules) he will continue to improve his weapon maste-ries and gain new general skills.

Saving Throws: The mystic's saving throws do not improve beyond the saving throws shown for the mystic class in Chapter 2.

## Nonlethal Combat

If characters want to fight to see who's the best warrior, but don't really want to injure one another seriously, or if they're trying to knock out an enemy without killing it, you can have them use Nonlethal Combat rules.

### Procedures

When characters are using Nonlethal Combat, they roll to hit and for damage normally.

![Illustration showing three figures in a medieval setting. Two figures are fighting with swords and shields, while a third figure stands nearby, observing. The illustration depicts a nonlethal combat scenario.]()![](_page_266_Picture_20.jpeg)

A player needs to adjust every damage roll he makes for his character. With every roll, he notes one-fourth (1/4) the damage rolled and rounds the number down; this is the *actual* damage. Then, he notes the remaining damage; this is the *nonlethal* damage.

Both actual and nonlethal damage are applied to the victim's hit points, but they are *recorded separately*.

When the actual damage plus the nonlethal damage equals the enemy's hit points, the enemy is unconscious. But only the actual damage is "real" damage; the nonlethal damage "wears off after a little while.

In 2d6 x 10 minutes, the victim will recover half the lost nonlethal damage, and wake up. An equal amount of time later, he'll recover the rest of the nonlethal damage hit points he has lost. He does not recover the actual damage hit points until he heals them through the usual means, such as a *cure light wounds* spell or rest. Magical curing heals actual damage first.

A character can opt to use Nonlethal Combat any time he utilizes one of the following attack forms:

1. Unarmed combat.
2. A weapon designed to do nonlethal damage—such as a wooden practice sword. You can automatically count shields (except spike-bearing shields), clubs, and the like as weapons designed to do nonlethal damage, but if you do, they won't do normal damage; they *only* do nonlethal damage in the campaign. A weapon designed to do nonlethal damage does exactly the same amount of damage as the weapon it simulates—but it can't be used to do normal damage.
3. Any hand-to-hand weapon.
4. A missile designed to do nonlethal damage—such as a blunted arrow.

If the character is using unarmed combat or a weapon specially designed for nonlethal damage, he fights with no penalty. If he's trying to use a normal weapon to do nonlethal damage, he suffers a -3 penalty to his attack roll. Nonlethal damage makes it easier to conduct duels, capture enemies, and stop people without killing them.

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_267_Picture_2.jpeg)

This appendix describes fantasy settings for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® games. Both are based on (or within) a planet in the Prime Plane known as Mystara. The settings are made up of the Known World, the outer world campaign areas where characters normally begin their careers, and the Hollow World, a mysterious, gigantic subterranean world the characters can discover and explore later. The Known World and the Hollow World have been described in a long-running series of game supplements published by TSR, Inc.; what follows is a brief description of the two campaign areas.

## The Known World

The Known World has cultures and a level of technological development that resemble the Europe of our Earth around the 15th century. The Known World doesn't have gunpowder or the printing press, but in many other ways the two worlds are similar.

Late-medieval feudalism is the most common system of government: A nobleman, usually a powerful warrior, rules a region of land, occupying a stronghold (often a castle) at its capital, guarding the region and enforcing his laws with soldiers normally drawn from the local population. The peasants of his region pay him taxes and services; he, in turn, protects them against invaders and evildoers.

Just as the peasants serve the noble, so too does the noble serve a greater ruler, a king or emperor. The petty noble supplies taxes to the greater ruler, and in times of war supports him with soldiers and additional money, and often must campaign with his king. The greater ruler, in turn, is obliged to protect the lesser ruler's claim to nobility, and to help protect the lesser noble in times of invasion. The oath of mutual service and support sworn between them is known as the *oath of fealty*.

In the Known World, many nations follow this pattern of government, and some follow other patterns. Some nations are populated entirely by demihumans and humanoids.

Take a look at the color maps on pages 273-288 for a closeup look at the Known World; a black and white overview map is found on pages 270 and 271. In this appendix, we're going to take a general look at the nations shown on those maps.

## The Grand Duchy of Karameikos

Description: This heavily-forested region used to be known as Traladara, a "nation" that was really a loose confederation of independent baronies.

Thirty years ago, Stefan Karameikos, an ambitious nobleman of the nearby Empire of Thyatis, traded his ancestral lands to the Thyatian emperor for Thyatian recognition of Karameikos' right to independent rule of Traladara. Spending all his family fortune on mercenary armies, Stefan Karameikos invaded Traladara, quickly conquering the nation's largest sea-port, Marilenev, and settling garrisons in all the region's larger communities.

He renamed the nation after himself: It became the Grand Duchy of Karameikos. Marilenev he renamed Specularum, a much more Thyatian sort of name. The Grand Duchy was recognized by Thyatis as an independent nation; although its rulers never called it a kingdom, that is effectively what it is.

Stefan Karameikos set up his own allies and cronies as regional rulers, allowing the original Traladarans rulers to retain their baronies only when they swore allegiance to him.

The Thyatian rulers, though they control the nation's economic and military might, don't have complete control of the land. Karameikos is dark and forested, with hundreds of square miles populated only by animals, by loggers and foresters, by non-humans such as elves and goblins. The Traladarans are an ancient home to vampires, werewolves and other dark creatures of legend. Secret Traladarans popular movements oppose the Thyatians, occasionally sabotaging the plans and activities of their rulers.

Ruler: Duke Stefan Karameikos, thirty years older and more experienced, still rules his land. He tries to keep his nation strong, the better to discourage invasion from dangerous neighbors—such as Thyatis. He does not actively oppress the Traladarans to improve the lot of his Thyatians; the laws he passes are written to be fair to all. But Karameikos himself cannot enforce every law, and many of his Thyatian subordinates are not as scrupulous in their dealings with the Traladarans. Karameikos' wife is Duchess Olivia, an icy, intelligent woman who is a good advisor for

him; his children include Lady Adriana (age 20, a notoriously independent fighter), Lord Justin (age 18, a slight young man with a talent for mathematics and trade), and Lord Valen (age 14, a clever and somewhat sneaky young man anxious to learn about the world).

Population: Karameikos is a divided land, its majority Traladaran population ruled by the invader Thyatian population. The Traladarans are a very free-spirited people whose dress and names are similar to those of Balkan Europe. The Thyatians are pragmatic and self-centered, with the conquering instincts of the ancient Romans (with their tastes in entertainment, too). The two elements tend to dislike one another greatly.

Specularum: The capital city of Karameikos has a population of 50,000 or more (the Traladarans don't willingly cooperate in the census). It features a great deep-water bay through which much shipping moves, the well-defended royal palace of the Karameikos family, a foreign quarter, a dangerous slum called "The Nest", several merchant districts, the walled-off Duke's Park, and much more.

Threshold: This northern town of 5,000 residents is a logging and farming community surrounded by untamed wilderness. It's an ideal home town for player characters. Threshold is ruled by Baron Halaran (also known as Patriarch Sherlane, a cleric).

Fort Doom: This is the capital of the Black Eagle Barony, which is ruled by Stefan Karameikos' cousin, Baron Ludwig von Hendriks. Von Hen-

![Illustration of a large, heavily forested planet or moon, possibly Karameikos, with radiating lines suggesting atmosphere or energy.]()![](_page_267_Picture_22.jpeg)

drisks is a dangerous man who terrorizes and brutalizes the populace of his dominion; he also conspires to take the throne of the Grand Duchy. Fort Doom has a population of 10,000.

**Adventure Opportunities:** The Grand Duchy of Karameikos really is a place of mysteries. So little of it is settled by humans that there is endless opportunity for adventure in the nation's woods and northern mountains. Ancient ruins lie here, long forgotten by the Traladarans and not yet discovered by the Thyatians: There are lairs where vampires lurk; there are caves from which goblin and bugbear raiders harry isolated settlements; there are hidden camps of Traladaran freedom fighters who plot the downfall of Stefan Karameikos.

## The Emirates of Ylaruum

**Description:** This is a desert land, all blazing sun, rolling dunes, and widely separated oases, similar in appearance and culture to medieval Arabia. In recent centuries, the Thyatians and Alphatians have come to Ylaruum to conquer; they moved in from the south and the north and fought in the center, their wars going on for decades until the Ylari people threw them out.

**Ruler:** The Sultan (Emperor) of the city of Ylaruum, a direct descendant of Al-Kalim, is the titular ruler of the nation, but he does not have absolute power; his Grand Vizier wields considerable influence, as do the individual emirs (kings), maliks (dukes), beys (counts), and sheiks (viscounts).

**Population:** The Alasiyan culture which is dominant in Ylaruum is as harsh as the desert that spawned it. The Ylari greatly admire the desert warrior, the turbanned hero with his flashing scimitar and noble desert steed.

**Magic use** is forbidden here; magic-users and elves are hunted down, tried, and executed when their presence becomes known. On the other hand, clerics are venerated in this land.

The Ylari follow the philosophies of Al-Kalim, a warrior and teacher who died (or embarked on a Path to Immortality) a century ago. His dream was of the Desert Garden, all the desert lands of Ylaruum transformed by work and cooperation into the greenest and fairest of lands; when the Ylari need something to unite them, they use the words of Al-Kalim.

Though the clans and tribes of Ylaruum often war with one another, they willingly forget their differences to band against foreign invaders, but just as willingly renew their internal struggles once the invasion is thrown back.

**Ylaruum:** The capital of the Emirates has a population (counting surrounding farmlands) of 20,000, about one-tenth the population of all the Emirates. It is a trade city, through which passes much of the agricultural bounty of the land: herd-beasts of the desert nomads, grains of the farmlands, fabricated goods of the renowned craftsmen of Ylaruum.

**Adventure Opportunities:** Adventures in the Emirates can include repelling Thyatian invaders from the south, grueling trips through the desert, exploring ancient ruins (dating from a time

when some of the most sterile desert areas were lush and green), and conducting negotiations between the emirs of this nation and the rulers of surrounding lands.

## The Principalities of Glantri

**Description:** This forested and mountainous northern land is a *magocracy*, a land ruled by magic-users. Clerics are outlawed (they're sentenced to death when found).

Glantri is divided into many principalities, each of which has its own ruler and laws:

Aalban is famous for the machines and devices its craftsmen make. Belcadiz is home to elves who are famous for their metalworks and their fine black lace; the elves in this nation live more like humans than elves, dwelling in fine houses and cities rather than sylvan communities. Bergdhoven is famous for its flowers (and the dyes and perfumes which come from them), its cheeses, and its jewelry and gemcutters. Blackhill is best-known for the quantity of its fruits and vegetables, and for the coal mined here. Boldavia is a major supplier of salt (mined by convicts and slaves) and ice (shipped hastily to Glantri City and other places). Caurenze is best known for its graceful marble architecture, and for its gold mines and fine weaponry. Erewan is a land of more traditional sylvan elves, who are fine bowyers, woodworkers, and artists. Klantyre is a major supplier of wool and mutton, lumber, and heavy woodwork. Krondahar is a producer of silk and leather goods, fine beef, and yogurt. New Averoigne is best-known for its wines and the culinary arts.

**Ruler:** The "ruler" of Glantri is actually a council of ten wizard-princes ruling a very efficient bureaucracy. The government needs to be efficient; the rulers like to plot against one another, but do not like the basic work of rulership. All rulers in Glantri are magic-users or elves; those who cannot cast spells cannot rule.

The ruling princes include: Aalban—Prince Jaggar von Drachenfels (human); Belcadiz—Princess Carmelia de Fedorias y Belcadiz (elf); Bergdhoven—Prince Vanserie Vlaardoen XI (human); Blackhill—Prince Volospin Aendyr (human); Boldavia—Prince Morphail Gorevitch-Woszlan (human/vampire); Caurenze—Prince Innocenti di Malapietra (human); Erewan—Princess Carlotina Erewan (elf); Klantyre—Prince Brannart McGregor (human/lich); Krondahar—Prince Jherek Virayana IV (human); New Averoigne—Prince Etienne d'Ambreville (human).

**Population:** The population is a blend of many ancient cultures, including very urban elves, descendants of Alphatians, Thyatian colonists, Traladarans, and even lycanthropes and vampires.

**Glantri City:** The capital of this nation, where the great college of magic is built, lies in a lush valley where two rivers meet. The city is crisscrossed both with roads and canals. It is a very sophisticated community, where magic lights the streets, where gondolas and hansom cabs convey passengers from point to point, and where every luxury imaginable is available.

# Appendix 1: The D&D® Game World

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_271_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Adventure Opportunities:** This is a good setting for a campaign if most of the characters are magic-users (and none overtly admits to being a cleric). With the great college of magic at hand to provide accidental monsters, new spells, and unintended portals into new worlds, there is a steady supply of adventure opportunity here.

## Alfheim

**Description:** This nation is a homeland of elves. Once a featureless plain, it was magically transformed into a deep, dense forest—ominous to outsiders, but a cheerful home to elves. This is a land of enormous trees, of elves cities made up of tree-houses hundreds of feet in the air and connected by wooden walkways. It's a place where few non-elves come unless they are invited or are attempting to invade.

**Ruler:** King Doriath is the day-to-day ruler of the elves of Alfheim; long-term decisions are made by the Council of Clans, which consists of the King and the Clanmasters of the seven major elven Clans of Alfheim.

**Population:** The people of Alfheim are all elves—excepting residents of Alfheim Town (10,000 humans, 300 dwarves, 800 halflings, and a few others). The elves here are much as they are in other parts of the world: Lithe and mysterious, magical and merry, they are worshippers of nature and growing things. They are no friends of the dwarves in Rockhome or of the humanoids in the Broken Lands.

**Alfheim Town:** The city that visitors are most likely to see is Alfheim Town, which has a population of 15,000—80% of which is non-elven.

**Adventure Opportunities:** Alfheim is a good place to spook low level adventurers, or to have sylvan adventures.

## Rockhome

**Description:** This is a land of low, fertile valleys surrounded by high and treacherous mountains. Rockhome is the homeland of the Known World's dwarves, and its thick ring of mountains suits them well, both defensively and aesthetically.

The dwarves build their communities of strong stone, using their famous engineering skills. Many Rockhome towns and villages are either built partially or completely underground, particularly in the large natural caverns that riddle this territory. This potent combination of surrounding mountains, defensive stone fortifications, and underground communities makes Rockhome difficult to invade.

**Ruler:** King Everast XV (formerly Bifin, son of Bofin, of the Everast Clan). Son of King Everast XIV, Everast XV spent his early career as a competent, if undistinguished, military officer. He is a career politician, a glib and affable dwarf who never shows his true face to outsiders. He is fond of finding enthusiastic young adventurers to send against threats facing Rockhome—threats, that is, that don't demand he roll out the military.

**Population:** Almost all residents of Rockhome are dwarves. The dwarves of Rockhome seem aloof, surly, and suspicious to outsiders, but they are merry and friendly among their own kind.

**Dengar:** This is the great capital city of Rockhome, built at the foot of—and beneath—Point Everast, the tallest mountain of Rockhome. The city is divided into two parts. Upper Dengar (population 15,000, including 1,500 humans and 150 halflings) is a strong, walled city built aboveground at the mountain's base. Where the city abuts the mountain, a great tunnel leads down to Lower Dengar (population 40,000, including 400 humans), a sprawling city built in an enormous series of natural caverns beneath the mountain.

**Adventure Opportunities:** Raids by humanoids from the Broken Lands are common, as are ambushes carried out by both sides.

## Soderfjord, Vestland, and Ostland

**Description:** These three nations, living in chilly northern coastal lands, are all similar to Viking cultures. The Soderfjord Jarldoms is a poor nation full of contentious jars (earls), and constantly plagued by humanoid invaders. Vestland is a mainland country with a history of military achievement. Ostland is an island nation with a great tradition of seamanship and piracy.

**Ruler:** Soderfjord Jarldoms: Soderfjord doesn't have one ruler; each jarl has his own very small independent nation. *Vestland:* King Harald Gudmundson, a modern and fair ruler, is advised by a council of representatives of Vestland's nobles, craft guildmasters, merchants, clerics, and others. *Ostland:* King Hord Dark-Eye, a middle-aged and traditional king (whose interest in rule has waned in the ten years since his first wife and unborn son died in childbirth), and Queen Yrsa, Hord's ambitious second wife; much political power also lies in the hands of clerics of the Immortal Odin.

**Population:** The men and women of Soderfjord, Vestland, and Ostland are a tall, fair, rugged breed. Shaped by their environment and their histories of warfare and noble adventure, they're a very aggressive lot.

**Adventure Opportunities:** Travelers in these lands could run afoul of Ostland pirates, or help the Vestland people against invasions from Trollheim and other humanoid areas, or be caught up in small-scale warfare between two competing jars in Soderfjord.

## The Five Shires

**Description:** This coastal nation that lies north of Ierendi is the homeland of the halflings ("hin"). Though these lands have been three times ruled by outsiders (twice by orcs, once by dwarves), the Five Shires are now ruled entirely by hin, and constitute an independent nation with a strong army and navy.

The Five Shires region is a broad, deeply-forested piece of rolling land. The land is quite fertile and hin farmers can get two or three harvests per year; the Five Shires export a lot of grain to Darokin, Glantri, and Karameikos.

The Five Shires is divided into five regions, called shires, each of which is semi-independent and ruled by a *sheriff*. The shires include Seashire, Highshire, Eastshire, Heartshire, and Southshire.

**Ruler:** There are five sheriffs—Seashire: Jaervos Dustyboots; Highshire: Multhm Greybeard; Eastshire: Maeragh Littlelaughs; Heartshire: De-lune Darkeyes; Southshire: Sildl Seayes.

**Population:** The great majority of residents of the Five Shires are halflings. But, while most humans think that halflings are peace-loving and harmless, there are many halfling adventurers and buccaneers in this region.

**Adventure Opportunities:** An orc invasion is always possible, and the hin would be grateful to PCs who stayed around to help.

## Thyatis

**Description:** Thyatis is a seaside empire, famous for its imperial history, the cunning and treachery of its leaders, the decadence of its entertainments, and the might of its army. In many ways, it resembles the Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire when its armies were achieving their greatest victories and its court was well into its decline.

The Empire of Thyatis consists of the Kingdom of Thyatis, the Pearl Islands (an island nation with a predominantly black population), the western half of the Isle of Dawn (an island settled by humans from many different races), Ochalea (an island settled by descendants of the mysterious, copper-skinned easterners called Alphatians), and the Hinterlands (the northern jungle fringe of the southern continent). Here, we'll deal only with the nation of Thyatis, heart of the empire.

Thyatis is a mostly flatland (with mountains bordering it to the north and running through the Island of Hattias to the south). The further west you go, the greener things are; the western border is heavily wooded.

Thyatis borders the Emirates of Ylraum to the north (and is normally unfriendly to them), Karameikos to the west (and remains friendly, although one day it will conquer that kingdom), and the Minrothad Guilds to the southwest (and remains friendly, trade relations are cordial). Elsewhere, the nation is bounded by seas, which have helped Thyatis become an important naval power with a tradition both of trade and piracy.

**Ruler:** Thincol I (Thincol Torion). Thincol was once a very famous gladiator in Thyatis City. Many years ago, during an invasion from the far-away empire of Alphatia, Thincol seized control of the city's troops and repelled the invaders. He later married the daughter of the emperor (who was slain in the invasion). Thincol is still a great fighter; he is also an accomplished politician in the Thyatan tradition of deception, cunning, and treachery.

**Population:** The people of Thyatis admire fighting ability above all else. They tend to be clever traders. Their politicians, merchants and ambitious military officers tend to be none too trustworthy, but the common adventurers are reliable enough.

**Thyatis City:** The capital and greatest city of the Empire is Thyatis City, population 600,000. Thyatis City is justly renowned for the magnificence of its marble architecture and the sophistication and decadence of its noble ruling class.

# Appendix 1: The D&D® Game World

![Decorative border image]()![](_page_288_Picture_2.jpeg)

Thyatis City is the empire's greatest seaport, with an enclosed and defended harbor, and is the seat of the empire's trade and naval fleets. Like ancient Rome at the height of the Roman Empire, it is a vibrant, teeming city whose population is so great that it strains against the very walls, whose people are enthralled by gladiatorial spectacle (the Coliseum seats nearly one-tenth of the city population at a time), and whose Senate is virtually a school for intrigue and deception.

**Adventure Opportunities:** Adventures in Thyatis can arise out of the empire's efforts to keep subject states in line, to conquer new territories, and to explore new territories to conquer. PCs adventuring in Thyatis need to be cautious about how they deal with employers and nobles; taking care to make it hard or unprofitable for their employers to betray them.

## Alphatia

**Description:** Alphatia is a mighty continent of magic-users to the east of the Thyatian Empire; it is not shown on any of the maps in this volume. Alphatia rules numerous other lands; all together, the main continent and its subordinate nations constitute the Alphatian Empire.

The continent of Alphatia is a broad, rich land divided up into numerous interdependent nations. The southwestern regions, the areas best known to visitors from foreign lands, are sunny and temperate, good for farmlands and pastures. The northwestern regions are chilly and mountainous, far wilder and less settled than the south. The northeastern section of the continent is also chilly wilderness; it has few human settlements, but is dotted with wizards' towers and the summer villas of Alphatian nobles. The southeastern part of Alphatia is flatland with rich soil, thick with farms. The central regions of the continent feature deep, dangerous forests where monsters thrive, where dangerous elves live free, and where the most evil of magic-users conduct their grisly experiments.

**Ruler:** Eriadna the Wise. Raised from childhood to be a ruler of men, she seized the imperial throne from her own father when the man launched a costly, failed invasion of Thyatis and the Alphatian grand council of wizards threatened to remove the imperial throne from her family line. She magically maintains her appearance at 30, though she is actually 80 and has five adult children.

**Population:** The Alphatians are not native to this plane. Their original home, far away in another plane, was destroyed in a war of opposing magic schools. The Alphatians came to the Known World and settled, building a new empire based on magic.

There are two kinds of Alphatians: common and pure. Common Alphatians have coppery skin and brown (sometimes red) hair. Pure Alphatians, a distinct minority, have very pale white skin and dark hair. Neither race has a social class advantage in the empire.

In the empire, all spellcasters are considered nobles; nonspellcasters have few rights. Spellcasters and nonspellcasters live under different sets of laws, laws which (naturally) favor the spellcasters.

**Sundsvall:** The imperial capital of Alphatia lies in the southwestern region of the continent. It is a vast city of 500,000 residents, and features innumerable huge palaces and other enormous buildings. As the capital of a magical empire, it is heavily decorated by and protected by magic spells, and is often called the "city built by magic."

**Adventure Opportunities:** Alphatia is a magical land that teems with wizards. They like to create new spells (or steal them from one another) or new monsters (these often break out of their pens and run amok).

## Other Areas of Note

**Atruaghin Clans:** These grassy plateau, forest, and hilly regions are inhabited by tribal herders and hunters who live in small villages. All the villagers claim to be descended from the ancient hero Atruaghin. If threatened by war, they will unite under a temporarily elected leader. Their culture is similar to early Amerindian culture.

**The Broken Lands:** This wasteland of rugged hills and mountains, infertile valleys and canyons, was long ago smashed by a man-made disaster. Since then, it has been an ugly and useless land, shunned by all but the humanoids; countless tribes of orcs, kobolds, goblins, hobgoblins, ogres, trolls, and other races who hate the humans who drove them here. They sometimes gather to raid surrounding nations. These barren lands are harsh and dangerous, but rumors persist of great magical treasures hidden here before the cataclysm.

**Caverns of the Shadow Elves:** Long ago, elves who survived the disaster that created the Broken Lands fled into the earth, finding deeper and deeper caverns to shelter them. Today, from their gray and cheerless caverns, they interact with the surface world only to scheme to gain control of Alfhheim or to pit surface nations against one another. The shadow elves are very pale and frail compared with outer-world elves. Their society closed and insular; they fear and distrust representatives of outside races.

**The Ethengar Khanates:** These northern steppes are broad, flat, windswept grasslands, ruled by the nomadic riders of the golden horde. The Ethengarians are steppe riders very similar to the Mongols. They are very warlike, and when they choose to stay organized, they are a great danger to nations all around them. Their "capital" is a tent (yurt) city of several thousand citizens that wanders across the face of the Khanate lands. At its center are the pavilions of the Golden Khan, a series of enormous tents surrounded by a wooden palisade.

**Heldann Freeholds:** The Heldann are a barbaric, fair-haired people who hunt, fish, and raise crops on isolated farms. They are related to the people in the jarldoms, but acknowledge no ruler among themselves higher than the individual household. Their culture is similar to that of medieval Iceland.

**Kingdom of Ierendi:** The trading ships of Ierendi rival those of Thyatis, and the kingdom sports

a magnificent royal palace carved from pure white coral. The king and queen of the land are usually popular adventurer-heroes; however, they are without true power and serve only as figureheads. Actual rule is held by certain aristocratic families (making Ierendi an oligarchy). Law tends to be informal, and enforced by the strong. Although Ierendi has a highly professional navy, pirates often operate out of Ierendi waters.

**Minrothad Guilds:** The Minrothad island cluster is a syndicocracy: The government is run by the heads of various trading guilds. Most of these are demihuman, with elves being the majority. The people are caste-conscious and conservative, preferring banking to war. They maintain a neutral position between Thyatis and Alphatia, trading with and transporting goods for both. Privateering, especially against pirates out of Ierendi, is common occupation.

**Norwold:** North of the jarldoms on the main continent lies the Kingdom of Norwald, carved out of the rugged northern coast by mighty warlords—adventurers of exceptional mettle (level 15+) who desire dominions of their own. Nominally loyal to Alphatia, the warlords have their hands full with petty local intrigues, incursions by unfriendly frost giants, and occasional full-scale invasions by the forces of both Thyatis and Alphatia. Norwold has a long-standing "land rush" that is expected to continue into the foreseeable future.

**Republic of Darokin:** This republic is centered around the capital, Darokin. Its wealth is based on trade from Lake Amsorak (the large inland lake), the Streeel river, the eastern caravan route, and sea trade filtering in through the Malpheggi swamp. Darokin is a plutocracy; the government is run by the wealthiest merchant families. The culture resembles that of Venice or Genoa in medieval Italy. While the settled areas are fairly safe, the wild areas are very wild.

**Thaneigoth Archipelago:** This cluster of islands is about 1,000 miles south of the main continent. What little is known about Thaneigoth is buried in myth and superstition, but there is at least one plateau "lost world" area, and many islands have tropical jungles, wherein dwell primitive tribesmen, aranea (intelligent spiders), and rakasta (cat people).

## The Hollow World

The planet of the Known World is not a solid ball like our Earth is. In fact, it's hollow. A tiny sun hangs in the center of the hollow, and vast polar openings permit travel between the inner and outer worlds. The interior landscape is called the "Hollow World," a place of ancient mystery.

The polar openings leading into the Hollow World are so huge that their curvature is very, very gradual. That, combined with the fact that these regions are perpetually shrouded in fog, means that people can travel from the outer world to the inner (or vice-versa) without being aware of it.

The interior sun sheds daylight at all times in the Hollow World; night never falls, and crea-

# Appendix 1: The D&D® Game World

![Decorative border element]()![](_page_289_Picture_2.jpeg)

tures susceptible to sunlight (such as vampires) are rare indeed.

The interior world has long been hidden from the outer world—the few outer-world explorers who have found it have either died there, stayed there willingly, or returned without publicizing their discovery. To this day, the existence of the Hollow World is not generally known in the outer world.

The Hollow World is home to monsters, animal species and cultures that have long vanished from the outer world. Every prehistoric animal species listed in the Chapter 14 is common in the Hollow World. Here, too, are nations that are ancestors of many of the outer world's cultures.

The Hollow World was set up by the Immortals of the Known World. Their influence has kept the cultures they have planted here virtually unchanged; each culture remains frozen at the cultural and technological level it had attained just prior to being brought here. The maps on pages 282 and 283 show several nations of the Hollow World, all of which lie on the great continent of Iciria.

**Important Note:** On maps of the Hollow World, the directions of East and West are reversed, an effect of its unique configuration. Therefore, if North is at the top, then West is to the right and East is to the left in the Hollow World.

## Modifications to Magic

Magic doesn't work the same in the Hollow World as it does in the outer world. A complete list of modifications is given in the HOLLOW WORLD™ boxed set. These are not given here so that players adventuring there for the first time can discover the effects for themselves.

## Hollow World Areas of Note

**Azcan Empire:** This ancient civilization of copper-skinned folk is dominated by jungle and slash-and-burn farmlands. The majority of its population lives in farming villages, but the empire has a number of large stone cities featuring ancient-style stepped pyramids. Although most of the people are of Neutral alignment, the empire is ruled by wicked clerics who obey Aztan-teotl, an Immortal of the Sphere of Entropy (Death). Strangers are normally captured and sacrificed in this land, which is much like the Aztec Empire at its height.

**Gentle Folk:** These forests are home to pacifistic elves. Their culture is basic (but more advanced than the Neathar) and their society unspecialized; the elves live by themselves or in small family groups. Neither Neathar nor dinosaurs willingly enter the lands of the Gentle Folk. Adventurers may find these lands a haven in which they can rest.

**Jennite Lands:** In the plains south of Tanagoro and west of Nithia dwell nomadic barbarian hunters, who follow large herds of *aurochs* (an ancient breed of oxen). They are fierce mounted warriors with copper skin and brown hair who scorn non-cavalry cultures. They war with both the Tanagoro and the Nithians.

**Kingdom of Nithia:** This nation, in the southwestern regions of the continent of Iciria, strongly resembles the real-world setting of ancient Egypt. The Nithians are a brown-skinned race of monument-builders. They are a very reverent people, and their ruler, a Pharaoh, is always a cleric. They are also a wealthy people, grown rich on the grain they export and the gold they mine. The Nithians are the perpetual enemies of the Milenians, even though great stretches of wilderness and hostile tribes separate the two empires.

**Kubitt Valley:** Lying south of the Schattenalfen and north of the Milenian Empire is Kubitt Valley. Adventurers who go there tend not to come back. It remains a place of mystery.

**Malpheggi Swamp:** This primordial swamp is inhabited chiefly by lizard men with an early Iron Age culture. Their tribal society is matriarchal, and they follow the Immortal Ka. They often guide Azcan and Schattenalfen raiding parties across the swamp to war upon each other. They are otherwise very territorial and, especially, will kill Nithians (their ancient enemies when both lived on the Known World).

**Merry Pirates:** Shipping in the seas off the equatorial coasts of the Azcan and Milenian Empires is often raided by the Merry Pirates, who live on islands many miles to the west. At times, the pirates will land and raid whole towns, and they sometimes raid each others' base towns as well. Their cheerful bluster is legendary, as is their daring. Their culture is much like that of the buccaneers and pirates of the Caribbean, except that there is no gunpowder.

**Milenian Empire:** Similar to Classical Greece at its height, this empire is protected by hoplite soldiers with crested helms, bearing long spears and sort swords. It controls much of southern Iciria. Its people are well-known for their architecture, building great homes and public buildings of marble, exquisite statues and columned temples, strong roads and defensive walls. Their perpetual enemies are the Nithians and the Schattenalfen, though they are often raided by the Merry Pirates as well.

**Neathar Lands:** These prehistoric plains, forests, and jungles are thickly occupied by small tribes of stone-age humans, called the Thousand Tribes of Neathar. The tribes often fight one another, but will ally with one another to drive out an invader. This region has many dinosaurs and other ancient animals per square mile. The Neathar language spoken here is the Common tongue of all the Hollow World.

**Schattenalfen Caverns:** Subterranean elves live in the mountains between the Azcans and the Milenians. These are descended from shadow elves who found the Hollow World by accident. Actually taking damage from sunlight (1 hit point/hour), they hate anyone who can withstand the sun. Many follow the evil Immortal Atzanteotl . . . a fact which doesn't prevent the Schattenalfen and Azcans from warring on one another whenever they choose.

**Tanagoro Plains:** West of Nithia dwell the Tanagoro tribesmen. They live in scattered villages, where they herd cattle (aurochs) and grow grain. The warriors are tall, black, and fierce, holding their own quite well against the Jennites, and destroying occasional invasions by both the Nithians and Milenians. Their culture is much like that of the Zulus of Africa.

## Appendix 2: AD&D® Game Conversions

ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® (or the AD&D® game) was a development of the D&D® game that was first published in the mid-1970s. While AD&D products are not directly compatible with this game, the guidelines in this section will help you if you want to use AD&D game supplements in your D&D game campaign or vice versa.

A short guide to D&D and AD&D game products will be given at the end of this appendix.

### Why Convert?

At some time, you may wish to convert a character, monster or entire adventure from one of these games to the other.

For example, you might be a D&D game Dungeon Master who finds and really enjoys an AD&D game supplement, so you want to convert it to be played in your campaign.

Or, you might be a D&D game player who moves to an area where only the AD&D game is played. You find a new DM who's willing to let you use your experienced characters... but first you must convert them to the AD&D rules system.

### The AD&D® Game

The AD&D game is much more detailed than the D&D game. It has more character classes, more alignment choices, more monsters, and more rules. Where the D&D rules system may reduce a situation to one die roll or a single variable, the AD&D rules system often has a more

detailed rule that includes more variables, allowing it to cover situations in much greater depth.

Since the AD&D game is so much more structured than the D&D game, it is used more often in convention tournaments, where consistent judging is most important.

The D&D game remains easier to learn, faster to play, and easier to introduce new players to.

### The AD&D® Core Rules

The AD&D 2nd Edition core rules include: the *Player's Handbook* (for players), the *Dungeon Master's Guide* (for the DM), and the first two *Monstrous Compendium* supplements (which contain monsters for the game). There are special rule supplements (the PHBR and DMGR series) and many AD&D campaign settings, as well as adventures, accessories, and even novels based on these game worlds.

### Game Differences

The most important differences for conversion purposes have to do with character generation and combat, as these affect game balance most directly. Specifics include:

- AD&D characters tend to have higher ability scores, especially if some of the optional character generation rules are used. However, ability score bonuses are generally gained at a score of 15 instead of 13.
- AD&D characters usually use different dice to roll hit points (for example, fighters roll d10).
- AD&D game clerics get spells at first level,

and often start with two or three spells.

- The AD&D system separates character class and character race. Different class and race combinations are available (e.g. dwarf fighter/thief).
- The AD&D alignment system adds a Good-Evil axis to the D&D game Law-Chaos axis, allowing greater detail (Lawful-Good, Chaotic-Neutral, etc).
- AD&D game spells are more complex. While one or two elements of a D&D spell may vary by caster level, any and all elements of an AD&D spell (range, duration, effect) might vary in this way. AD&D spells also are more likely to have multiple effects or reversals.
- AD&D game magical items are more complex; many have three or more separate functions.
- The systems have different combat round time scales (affects encounter pacing).
- The AD&D system uses a 10-point armor class scale.
- AD&D game weapons inflict different damage against larger-than-man-sized opponents than against smaller opponents.
- Equipment prices and encumbrance numbers are different between the two systems.
- Some D&D optional rules (Fighter Maneuvers, Weapon Mastery, and so on) have no equivalent in the AD&D system.

Aside from these differences, the systems are balanced differently. The D&D game retires player characters at level 36; the AD&D game encourages player character retirement about level 20.

## Appendix 2: AD&D® Game Conversions

### Converting Between the Games

In the following sections, we'll describe how to convert items from one game to the other. In all cases, transfers of characters and other things between campaigns are monitored and approved by the hosting DM.

#### Reality Shifts

One convenient assumption is that D&D® and AD&D® games are alternate realities, in alternate dimensions. Passing through the dimensional barrier may cause certain changes to the character and his equipment, some of which may not be immediately obvious.

For example, a character with a large amount of treasure entering a treasure-poor game, might find most of his treasure disappears, leaving him with the need to continue adventuring. Likewise a low-level character, who enters a campaign where the average party level is high, might discover he has gained a few levels. On the other hand, a powerful magical item that the DM thought would be all right but is causing balance problems might malfunction a few weeks or months after passing the dimensional barrier.

### Characters

When you want to convert a character between the two games, use the following checklist. It will allow you to convert all significant character details to the other game.

When converting a character from one game system to another, the character gains all attributes and restrictions of the race and class he is being converted to. He loses any bonuses and penalties he had under the old system. He makes attack rolls, saving throws, etc., according to the new system.

The same principle holds for converting equipment, spells, and magical items: use equivalent rule of the system you will be playing in. For example, if an AD&D game broad sword does 2d4 points of damage, then its D&D game equivalent does 1d8 points of damage (that is, it's a "normal sword").

Any ability, skill, spell, item, spell, or other detail that has no equivalent in the other game is lost, unless the DM makes a special adjustment (see "Optional Class Conversions," given later).

When converting from the more complex AD&D system, simplify game procedures as much as possible.

#### Converting Characters Table

| Ability Scores            | To D&D® System  | To AD&D® System |
|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Basic scores              | Use AD&D score* | Use D&D score** |
| Ability score adjustments | Use D&D system  | Use AD&D system |

\* If the AD&D campaign uses the 4-die generation system, subtract 1 from Prime Requisites and 2 from other ability scores.

\*\* If the AD&D campaign uses the 4-die generation system, add 2 to Prime Requisites and add 1 to other ability scores.

In addition, all scores lower than the minimum the system requires for the class are adjusted to the minimum. No score can be adjusted above 18 or below 3.

| Class/Race       | To D&D System                                    | To AD&D System        |

| Human dual-class | Current active class                             | —                     |

\* AD&D spheres do not convert well. Use cleric, druid, paladin, or avenger, whichever is closest. Demihumans revert to class, losing clerical abilities.

\*\* AD&D character class or race.

t Optionally, allow a one-time choice of halfling fighter/thief.

tt Detailed in the *Oriental Adventures* rules book; otherwise dual-class fighter/thief (advances as fighter).

Abilities and powers that the class does not have in the game system that has been converted to are lost. Thus a 15th level fighter converted to the AD&D system would lose the ability to use the Smash maneuver because the AD&D system doesn't have a Smash maneuver. Use the racial ability rules for the system to which you are converting.

Unless noted above, basic hit points (those from Hit Dice) do not change. Thus a dwarven fighter/thief converted to the D&D system would have a base number of hit points from hit dice equal to his AD&D amount. The hit point adjustment given above are *per Hit Die*, not per level. These are base hit points, to be modified by the Constitution bonus of the system you are converting to. For high levels, use the additional hit points per level of the system to which you are converting.

Converting Characters Table (continued)

| Experience Level | To D&D® System          | To AD&D® System           |
|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1-12             | No change               | No change                 |
| 13+              | One equals 3 D&D levels | Three equal 1 AD&D level* |

\* Round fractions down.

Note that *levels* are converted, not XP. For example, a 14th level AD&D character would be an 18th level D&D character. A 33rd level D&D character would be a 19th level AD&D character.

*Multi-class* AD&D characters use the level of their D&D class. *Dual-class* AD&D characters use their active class.

The DM can always choose to alter the level of characters entering a campaign for purposes of game balance.

AlignmentTo D&D: Keep the Lawful-Neutral-Chaotic alignment and use the Good-Evil axis as a guide to role-playing.

To AD&D: Use past behavior as a guide to assign a Good-Neutral-Evil alignment.

SpellsUse the equivalent spells of the system to which you are converting. If no equivalent exists, knowledge of the spell is lost.

| Equipment     | Use D&D system | Use AD&D system |
| Encumbrance   | Use D&D system | Use AD&D system |

\* However, the amount the character is left with should be put into balance with the amount of treasure in the campaign the PC is entering.

Skills & ProficienciesTo D&D System: *Weapon mastery* of "expert" or better translates to weapon specialization for fighter class characters only. If more than one weapon is eligible, the player can choose only one. The character is proficient in all weapons in which he has at least "basic" mastery.

To AD&D System: *Weapon specialization* becomes a weapon mastery of "expert" in the specialized weapon. The character receives all additional masteories due to a character of his D&D level.

Nonweapon: Use the closest equivalent in the current system being used.

The character is subject to any class weapon limits of the system to which he converts. If the DM does not use the equivalent system or if no equivalent weapon exists, the benefit is lost.

Optional Class ConversionsMany AD&D® class and race options will not convert directly to the D&D® system, especially multiclass and dual-class options. If the DM wants to experiment with allowing AD&D game individuals to keep their special abilities, the following guidelines are recommended. We strongly recommend that only characters transferring from AD&D campaigns use these conversions.

Combination Single ClassesThese are single-classed demihumans who are clerics, mages, or thieves. Possible combinations are given in the AD&D rules.

- Hit dice are the same as humans of these classes.
- XP tables are the same as the human class.
- Advancement limits are those of the demihuman type. No spells or thief abilities increase past the last level, but the demihuman rank abilities are gained normally.
- Racial abilities are the same as the race.

Multiclass DemihumansThese are treated as combination single classes except:

- The Elf class is the equivalent of an AD&D fighter/mage. An AD&D elf fighter/mage converts as a standard Elf.
- Hit dice for all human and demihuman classes are both rolled and the results are *averaged* (round down).
- The XP table of the class that gives the slowest advancement beyond name level is used.
- Earned XP is *halved*.

Dual-Class HumansThese humans can operate in two classes, subject to the following:

- They advance only in their active class; the inactive class can be used but never improves.
- They get the most advantageous saving throw, considering class and level.
- They can use any magical item available to either of their classes.
- They make attacks based on their class and level—a fighter/thief 7/5 could attack as a 7th level fighter or backstab as a 5th level thief.

Druids and PaladinsThese can be allowed in D&D play at less than 9th level, if desired.

GnomesThe following optional rules can be used:

- Gnomes use halfling details unless otherwise noted.
- Gnomes have the attacks and saving throws of dwarves.
- Gnomes speak gnome, dwarf, goblin, and kobold.
- Instead of the *hiding* ability, gnomes have the dwarf *detect trap* and *infravision* abilities.

# Appendix 2: AD&D® Game Conversions

![Decorative header graphic]()![](_page_293_Picture_2.jpeg)

## Monsters

Use a similar system to convert monsters from one game system to the other. If a similar monster already exists in the system you are converting to, use those statistics. Otherwise the guidelines in the Converting Monsters Table can be used. Given values are those in the system you are converting from.

### Additional AD&D® Monster Statistics

The following AD&D® statistics have no D&D® equivalent, but can often be found in the monster description. Including them is optional. They are as follows:

- ORGANIZATION: (tribal, herd, flock, etc.).
- ACTIVITY CYCLE: (nocturnal, diurnal, etc.).
- DIET: (carnivore, herbivore, etc.).
- THACO: Use D&D attack number.
- SPECIAL ATTACK: Use D&D equivalent, if there is one.
- SPECIAL DEFENSE: Use D&D equivalent, if there is one.
- MAGIC RESISTANCE: Assume no special resistance to magic.

If you like a special monster power that does not exist in the D&D system, feel free to adapt it to your game. For example, although magic resistance is not a standard rule, there is no reason why a special monster of this type could not be introduced by the DM as a special encounter.

## Magical Items

Magical items should be converted to an equivalent item in the base system. For example, the AD&D *cloak of elvenkind* would become an *elven cloak*, a *wand of fire* would become a *wand of fireballs*, etc. If no equivalent exists, the DM may decide that the item isn't there, that a comparable item has replaced it, or that he will translate the given item into the base system. When converting AD&D items to the D&D game, try to limit the number of effects they can create and simplify use as much as possible.

## Immortals and Deities

The Immortals of the D&D system and the deities of the AD&D system should not be converted between the game systems.

## Measurements

Game measurements are not converted; use the equivalent measurements of the system to which you convert.

## Appendix 4: Indices

### Index to Spells

This is an index of all spells appearing in this *Cyclopedia*. The spells are arranged alphabetically, and each spell has a notation beside it in parentheses. The letter in parentheses stands for the type of spell it is (C = clerical, Dr = druidic, MU = magical), and the number stands for the spell level (1 = 1st level, etc.). Therefore, a notation such as "(C 7)" would mean "7th level clerical spell." Spells with multiple notations appear in different places in the spell lists in Chapter 3.
